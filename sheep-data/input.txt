Lest you find yourself amongst the bones, 
Mask your face and quiet your soul. 

Flock in lines of the mundane and meek,
Zip your lips, peaceful keep. 

This genocide of individuality is perverting our kind, incestually. 
Perfect patterns, mechanically, processed, soundly. 
Some people fleeing some other people. 
In some country under the sun 
and some clouds. 

They leave behind some of their everything, 
sown fields, some chickens, dogs, 
mirrors in which fire now sees itself reflected. 

On their backs are pitchers and bundles, 
the emptier, the heavier from one day to the next. 

Taking place stealthily is somebody's stopping, 
and in the commotion, somebody's bread somebody's snatching 
and a dead child somebody's shaking. 

In front of them some still not the right way, 
nor the bridge that should be 
over a river strangely rosy. 
Around them, some gunfire, at times closer, at times farther off, 
and, above, a plane circling somewhat. 

Some invisibility would come in handy, 
some grayish stoniness, 
or even better, non-being 
for a little or a long while.

Something else is yet to happen, only where and what? 
Someone will head toward them, only when and who, 
in how many shapes and with what intentions? 
Given a choice, 
maybe he will choose not to be the enemy and 
leave them with some kind of life.

The flawed are pushed aside, 
The individuals are boxed up, shipped out, Pariahs. 

So, don your masks, one and all!
Suit up, and watch your sheeple fall.

You were always trying to get closer
Approaching me in manners mysterious to me
Roaring words of love in my ear

With thrusts of your hips,
Slowly you found a way into me,
Pinned me down, ready to eat your prey

And I screamed, but I was not looking for help
I was not trying to get saved
This is where I wanted to be.
Don't set me free.

The hills step off into whiteness.
People or stars
Regard me sadly, I disappoint them.

The train leaves a line of breath.
O slow
Horse the colour of rust,

Hooves, dolorous bells ----
All morning the
Morning has been blackening,

A flower left out.
My bones hold a stillness, the far
Fields melt my heart.

They threaten
To let me through to a heaven
Starless and fatherless, a dark water.

I wonder if sheep look up at the sky and get sad. 

They're crying for the other sheep to come back.

Humans are like sheep
I think
For when the dog of conformity barks
We all get back in line.

Dirty and naked we are free
to roam the ethereal stuff of dreams
thunderstorms kiss us goodnight
punks and roamers, we put up the good fight
old oak floors and flags in the wind
open palms confessing sins
arms outstretched we take a leap
into waters cold and deep

Thousands of sheep, soft-footed, black-nosed sheep--
one by one going up the hill and over the fence--one by
one four-footed pattering up and over--one by one wiggling
their stub tails as they take the short jump and go
over--one by one silently unless for the multitudinous
drumming of their hoofs as they move on and go over--
thousands and thousands of them in the grey haze of
evening just after sundown--one by one slanting in a
long line to pass over the hill--

I am the slow, long-legged Sleepyman and I love you
sheep in Persia, California, Argentine, Australia, or
Spain--you are the thoughts that help me when I, the
Sleepyman, lay my hands on the eyelids of the children
of the world at eight o'clock every night--you thousands
and thousands of sheep in a procession of dusk making
an endless multitudinous drumming on the hills with
your hoofs.

Many in this world will become wolves and even more will be sheep.

It is the few who become shepherds that protect the sheep from being populated by the wolves of hatred, fear, and willingness to appose such on the sheep, that are the true protectors, heroes and great leaders that young men and woman should strive and wish to be. 

The way of the wolf is one that will turn your heart black, your back to your friends, and your back to the world that will cause your mind to become all that is evil, wrenched, and destructive on this Earth. 

Become the shepherd
Drive out the wolf

I am a sheep wrought with steel wool that’s coarse and painful to the touch
It erupts anything that touches me into a throng of agitated skin disease
So I habitually avoid anyone and anything that nears me with my terrified animalistic eyes
For fear of watching some curious creature bleed because of me and my dangerous idiocy
However as a sheep with sheep tendencies I can’t help but follow after the herd of my family
From a distance; trotting over trodden grass that’s easier on my hooved feet 
Than other paths that are less traveled, more dangerous and more interesting
Instead staring at my family’s tail ends with an envy too poignant for my age
As they baa and cackle and coo over their own amusements and mutual understandings
And I find myself wishing woefully that I wasn’t just a sheep with steel wool
But a ferocious wolf, independent and beautiful; merely hiding within an ugly costume
Let the snake wait under
his weed
and the writing
be of words, slow and quick, sharp
to strike, quiet to wait,
sleepless.
-- through metaphor to reconcile
the people and the stones.
Compose. (No ideas
but in things) Invent!
Saxifrage is my flower that splits
the rocks.
I feel like I'm your shepherd
Fighting off the wolf with a staff
But you
Oh you, silly sheep
Keep following the wolf 
His claw curled in summoning
His howls soft and comforting
Yet they send shivers up my spine
And my blood to boil with anger
I beat the wolf round the head
Tearing his fur 
I'll make him wish he were dead
For seducing my sheep with his hungry eyes
His honey gaze
His bitter glaze
I'll rip out his fur before her gets to you, my sheep
But the sheep doesn't understand me
THE WOLF IS DANGEROUS
I scream until my throat bleeds
But still
My dearest sheep tilts her head
And saunters off into the forest
Where the wolf it waiting with wet lips
Jaw twitching in anticipation
Maybe I should let you be eaten, little sheep
I could scream all I want
Show you my dead flock
But you won't listen
Maybe I'll just let you get eaten
I'm tired of saving your life
I, too, sing America.

I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.

Tomorrow,
I'll be at the table
When company comes.
Nobody'll dare
Say to me,
"Eat in the kitchen,"
Then.

Besides,
They'll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed--

I, too, am America.
My life runs in circles
Whilst the flock avoids my space 
Every word I speak
Brings destruction to my family
The truth tears apart relationships
When the lies destroy my soul
It's hard being the black sheep 
But it's all I know 
Every time I do my best
It fails before my eyes
And my depression was never a big enough sign for them to see me down
Black sheep black sheep 
Kill yourself now
Before you reproduce
A flock surrounded by bad luck

Are you a Black Sheep?
The one they all say is responsible
For every unwanted moment
So selfish
Ah yes, you must be self involved
Why?
Because you are different
Because they do not understand
What you are
That you are alone
Sad
Desperate
Wanting to be accepted
That is all a Black Sheep can ask
But Black Sheep you shall remain
It is alright friend
I understand

Men so quick 
to point the finger. 

When, they share equal 
guilt. 
In the alleged crime as well. 

We're poster children 
The few who got branded.

A scarlet letter,curse.
Many share. 
But few wear. 

Every white sheep,
is matched up with a black one. 
To keep the flock in balance. 

There are more of us. 
Hidden in your slipping eyesight.

A family of sheep live in harmony, all from different areas
Different ages and different ideas. They all came together 
United in a friendship, strong enough to be called a family
But there are wolves out there…. Terrible creatures that
Want nothing more to attack the sheep. They once might
Of been sheep, but something dark and twisted shaped them
Into the creatures they are now. They stalk, coming closer to
The family, moving in to destroy the harmony they live in
But as they come close they feel a presence pushing at them
Something protecting the sheep, something dark as them, sending
Shivers down the wolves spines, something terrible enough
To scare the mighty wolves

A mighty bear, massive in size, vast bigger than the wolves
The bear has strong curved claws ready to attack any that
Approach. Its speed is also a deadly trait the bear possesses
Able to out run any evil coming at him. The bear also has a 
A super amazing sense of smell, able to smell the stench from
Miles away. 
The bear perks up, catching the smell of a creature that doesn’t 
Belong…

The other creature is the sheepdog. Though not as big as the 
Bear the sheepdog has a presence that scares the wolves.
The sheepdog has fangs as long as the wolves and attacks
Just as ferocious as the wolves. While the bear knows when
Violence can be avoided by scaring the wolves away, the 
Sheepdog does not know this, he jumps at the violence
Instead, taking the impulse to attack and destroy, marking
Him close to the wolves.

The bear circles to the sheepdog and together they move to 
The wolves, ready to protect the family behind them
The wolves leave, scattering to avoid them, facing away
From the ever presence

Dear sheep.
Try to sleep.
It's too late.
My mind awaits.
For beautiful 
dreams.
At least I hope
it seems.
Late night.
Sweet 
good night.
The calm, 
Cool face of the river
Asked me for a kiss.
I'm the black sheep 
I'm the outcast
And I'm the reason people don't come over to the house 
I kick and I buck 
I don't fall in line 
Nothing I do is good enough for this family of mine 

I once blended in
But then I got rejected 
Slowly turning my life 
In a different direction 
I am the black sheep of my family of seven 
I'm unique 
Special
Distinctively Distinct 
I am the peculiar one
The unusual one 
The idiosyncrasy of the group 
"Why do I love" You, Sir?
Because—
The Wind does not require the Grass
To answer—Wherefore when He pass
She cannot keep Her place.

Because He knows—and
Do not You—
And We know not—
Enough for Us
The Wisdom it be so—

The Lightning—never asked an Eye
Wherefore it shut—when He was by—
Because He knows it cannot speak—
And reasons not contained—
—Of Talk—
There be—preferred by Daintier Folk—

The Sunrise—Sire—compelleth Me—
Because He's Sunrise—and I see—
Therefore—Then—
I love Thee—
I am the daughter that can not be accepted 
So I live in rejection

Mary, Mary let go of that sheep
It has bleat too loudly as we lay asleep
Feet in one steady direction
Out from the pen its throes

Mary, Mary the meadows are fresh
Though they are green only for so long
The dogs have slung them over their heads
Strung out from wayward beds

The clueless drunk shepherd that was your father
Waiting at the neck of foreign spirits
Sheathed it like a monkey peeling bananas
For a fat buck a glass, what's it to him?

Poor little sheep, shivers from the whipping air
Clouds gone too soon
For the rich merchants
With hanging gold in their mouths

Mary, Mary, poor little sheep
Jumped over the fence
Probably too hurt to walk alone
Thorns and rocks ahead
But they must have been better than the cold in his head

Mismatched rambling lines
All going with the times
The random erratic flow
The constant stop and go
All signs point outward
From a single point we are moving backward and forward
Too long have we been condensed
Like sheep herded fed and fenced
It is time to run,time to fly
Knock down the fence or die
And spread out into the open field
Though no one knows what it will yield
The sheep will over come the herder
They will not get away with murder 
Wake up from your sleep
Though it is lovely and deep
Awaken and see that the world is burning
And the herder doesn't find it concerning.

A sheep drowned whole
in color black.
Stripped clean of all,
naught but his soul. 

My blood has robbed
All past power
My blood has pushed
Off Babel's tower

Alas my castle
a cage has turned
for my deliverance
my spirit yearned. 

The time of which
I may once leave.
The time of which
My burden heave 

The sheep's spirit
in tatters lie
in color black
the stench of dye

He was never this way
He grew into position
He was never this way
he once had better disposition.

The sheep he screams
as the dye once again nears.
This time with a stench
Of unmistakable permanence.

'Tis a tale, a sorry tale
Of a man, never took the leap
Of a man, free yet caged
A lion amongst the sheep.

A man of great ability,
Of unrealized potential
Confined and clipped by limits
The herd had deemed essential.
It is blue-butterfly day here in spring,
And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry
There is more unmixed color on the wing
Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry.

But these are flowers that fly and all but sing:
And now from having ridden out desire
They lie closed over in the wind and cling
Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire.
A man, a brilliant man,
Stripped of glory and his claws.
Left forlorn and wounded
By the sheep and their laws.

A man, a greater man
Led by the lesser to believe
He owed them much and more
And everything, without reprieve.

A man, a most herculean man
Could have the world, his to keep.
Alas had he only remembered
He was a lion, not a sheep.

A heart that I could call a home
A home that I might find my heart
Walking up a hill at night
Rolling down when sun shines bright
Lift me up into your arms night sky
So that I might cry with tears of joy
To know that there could be a home
For every girl and boy of any age
As this would be my home
You may come and stay
To get away or just to play 
Beneath the stars
We'll say good night
And restful sleep
Rest our heads 
On loving sheep
Until the dawn

In fields you walk with cloven wanderlust
With blankets carried on your back as fleece
Protecting fellow sheep-fold innocence
From devious behavior in the flock
Smiling as you bleat and stride as golden
Reflecting rays like sunlit drops of milk

A lamb of God your knowledge is your milk
Your curiosity breathes wanderlust
A message from the ancient one baas golden
Engraved upon your heart and curls of fleece
Observe the blessed range within your flock
Stray not for you may lose your innocence

A fog in hills may blind your innocence
Beware the wolf will take more than your milk
And with each day you bond among your flock
Behold the beauty of group wanderlust
We thank you for your warm and cherished fleece
That soothes us as earth's twilight breaks golden

Glory to the impossible golden
For myths of your spiritual innocence
Merely trumpets what liberates your fleece
The holy grail is your chalice of milk
Discovered in a cave of wanderlust
Restful within the shadow of your flock

What joy is raised in stables of your flock
An offering of ritual golden
Pasture of thirsty hearts in wanderlust
You teach us to hold fast to innocence
How precious is the richness of your milk
Our comfort is to rest our heads on fleece

A new dawn to behold an age of fleece
A new dusk to protect an ancient flock
A new day to preserve the gift of milk
A new memory to hold futures golden
A never ending age of innocence
A satiated age of wanderlust

Fruitful wanderlust of black sage fleece
Shepherds innocence to a white cloaked flock 
Prepare ye golden moments with thine milk

i have known nights
where men walk the sun
and the stars count people

sheep huddle together
in grassy fields
dreaming
of fences
worn down

see, the funny thing
about nights is
at some point
you can’t tell the difference
between the first
and the last

(And hey, 
Diddle diddle
The cat’s lost his fiddle
Orion’s got a belt
Round his neck)

the lass
on the moon
plucks planets
from the blue
and decorates
the tangles in 
her hair

see, the funny thing
about dreaming is
at some point
you can’t tell the difference 
between what hurts
and what doesn’t

(The cat’s started drinking
Orion’s stopped thinking)

dawn
decides to sleep in
for just 
another hour
or two

see, the funny thing
about nights is 
i have always known them 
but know nothing
of you

And the fiddle has gone out of tune

Sheep are but charcoal
Disguised in cotton
Snowflakes, hardly hidden
Behind never-ending stretches 
Of dry-stone walls
Lilies on lily pads, abstract art

The sky is but a mirror
Blown away, twisted and reversed
Splashes and swirls of white
Painted by the wind
Illusions of eyes and limbs
Carelessly splattered across its canvas

We are but the colour-blind
Azure, or emerald?

One twenty-three and still not asleep,
awake in regret for not counting sheep.

They hopped that white fence and flew to the sky,
across many fields and into the night. 

So stop chasing dreams and just pet the sheep,
for this action still will grant you some sleep.

And next time you stop to look way up high,
you'll understand how clouds got to the sky.

there are no sheep.
just wolves with
sheepish tendencies,
each boasting the
ability to bite.
-
rust falls in
dusty flakes
only to make
room for new.

paint chips.
wilted petals.
baby teeth.

expelled
replaced
by something 
bigger and better.

when there's
only room for
the one of 'em.

a mushroom doesn't grow
on top of another mushroom
but next to it.
Some people fleeing some other people. 
In some country under the sun 
and some clouds. 

They leave behind some of their everything, 
sown fields, some chickens, dogs, 
mirrors in which fire now sees itself reflected. 

On their backs are pitchers and bundles, 
the emptier, the heavier from one day to the next. 

Taking place stealthily is somebody's stopping, 
and in the commotion, somebody's bread somebody's snatching 
and a dead child somebody's shaking.

Someone will head toward them, only when and who, 
in how many shapes and with what intentions? 
Given a choice, 
maybe he will choose not to be the enemy and 
leave them with some kind of life.

quiet now.
just the cold caress
of the breeze left.
no more salty
sweat or tears.

rustfree, scratchproof.
temporarily titanium.

until
an agonizing internal groan
like industrial sabotage
of factory machinery.
gears grind and steam moans.
everything jerks to a halt.

the mechanic is a cannibal.
they're all bloodsuckers really.

no noble stairs around here anymore.
just elevators, that only lift you up
when they get to come along.
not like stairs at all.

"Count the sheep
To go to sleep"
Said my mom when i was little

"Count the sheep
Rather than weep"
And i listened
For that riddle

I listened for my mother
For my whole life
But for now

Now i must listen
When my heart 
Subseeds to frown

And that riddle echos on
And my mind begins to spin
And without a doubt
I have to shout...
The sheep will soon run out

"Count the sheep
To go to sleep...
Until you count no more,
Then go to bed, and wait instead,
Until you know what you wait for."
To him who in the love of nature holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty; and she glides
Into his darker musings, with a mild
And healing sympathy that steals away
Their sharpness ere he is aware. When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--
Go forth, under the open sky, and list
To Nature's teachings, while from all around--
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air--
Comes a still voice. Yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding sun shall see no more
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go 
To mix forever with the elements,
To be a brother to the insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold. 

Yet not to thine eternal resting-place
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world -- with kings,
The powerful of the earth -- the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun, -- the vales
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods -- rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,
Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste,--
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom. -- Take the wings
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save his own dashings -- yet the dead are there:
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep -- the dead reign there alone. 

So shalt thou rest -- and what if thou withdraw
In silence from the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one as before will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glides away, the sons of men--
The youth in life's fresh spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man--
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,
By those, who in their turn, shall follow them. 

So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, which moves
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
Trying to sleep but my eyes open wide
With voices whispering from every side,
Battles in my mind and nowhere to hide,
a futile resistance against the rising tide.

Thought after thought taunting my soul,
As this constant barrage takes its toll,
Eating away slowly now a gaping hole,
My mind going crazy and out of control.

I know not why I cannot rest,
Thoughts of random is all I possess,
A decent nights sleep, and I'll be blessed,
5 minutes and I'm unimpressed.

I always loose the fight to sleep,
I've counted every last sheep,
Watched them 'baa' as they leap,
Watch them land in a heap.

I give up, I might as well,
Just leave my sleeplessness to dwell,
Bid my dreams farewell,
Cos everynight I'm met with hell...

While most are counting sheep at night
When trying to go to sleep
The poet is searching for words to write
So the little lambs won't weep

The paper becomes the poet's sleeve
As he wipes his pain away
His pen becomes the poet's sword
To keep the wolves at bay

The sheep that cause our eyes to close
Must always be protected
For wolves can sneak into our dreams
Sometimes undetected

The poet writes of the sheep we count
While staring at the clock
Writing words to stop the wolves
From picking off the flock

So when you start to close your eyes
And count the sheep tonight
Remember the poet who slays the wolves
With the words that he will write

out in the
pasture I
keep my
wool and
graze in
the tall
grass
discontent
with the paths
that make no
sense, please, 
find

me.

Fields of green
Tall blades of grass
The dew of the morning still making it shine
    and sparkle from the bright sun

In the far yonder sheep peacefully stray
United as a pact
Never leaving each others side
White and beautiful 

Off to the side
Where the thunder always stays
The sun never shines
One sheep is astray

She isn't beautiful or graceful
Her coat black and matted
Her hooves cracked and her eyes dark

She tries to join the family
But is tied tight to the fence of 
Humility and shame
The black sheep will never be good enough
To be wanted or proud

The pact only allows
Sheep that are perfect
There's no room for the one
Who fell astray one day

Why can't they just see
That all she desires is to be wanted
To feel love and not shamed
And never again be taunted

Heart in torment to weep
untold pain the soul doth keep
Unseen wounds thrust deep
loneliness a company in nights sleep
away from crowd the black sheep

I'd rather be a poor shepherd,
than a rich sheep.

I am a sheep,
Just one in a herd of many,
For once it would be nice to be heard
But as usual I am afraid to speak up.

Just following along like a sheep in the farm
Doing as I am told, not doing as I wish.
Just step up and think for myself.
I wish it were that easy for me…

I will fall back in line to get lost with the clones.

Slowly the field gets smaller and smaller,
Where is everyone going?
Left nothing behind, no memories, no stories.
They were never heard…

Speak up now, or forever remain silent, 
I wish to be heard, but I have no idea what to say.
Would anyone even listen?
I don’t think so….

Just a Sheep…

I tried so hard to have my voice heard,
But once again nothing comes out,
It happens time and time again.
I cant break this curse.
Think for myself!
I want to think….

Just continue to follow and follow….
Until I break,
I cant stay silent, 
I WILL speak up!
I am done following the sheep in this herd.

I Will be Heard
Will you listen?...
Please listen

Are we
Sheep
To be herded in lines
Sheared of all that makes us valuable
Powerless

Legs weak and pink
We hold ourselves as tall as we can
Transfigured to be the same as everyone else
Unsatisfied

Bleating feebly from hoarse throats
Brushing up against each other desperately
Tufts of hair shooting from thin bodies
Alone

Led off to slaughter
Freed

Losing sleep,
Can't close my eyes.
Counting sheep,
But I've been over this a thousand and five times,
Asking why,
You're still on my mind.

I'm a sheep!
I'm a sheep, and my,
shepherd loves me, I mean
he fought the wolf for me,
he washes my wool, and takes
care of me.

My eyes are growing weary 
From counting all these sheep 
I'm trying to stay awake
When I'd much rather, sleep.

I can't seem to understand it
Why they are this way

The blind following noises
Just to make it through the day?

Do they choose to walk this path 
Because they're afraid of being alone?
Or do they choose to walk this path 
So the blame is not their own?

"I was just doing what they said!"
"I thought it would be okay..."
"I've never done this before."
"Man, I feel so ashamed..."

Where is the responsibility?
Where are the roles?
Everyone's a sheep 
And thy cannot make it on their own

Do not fear a wolf
For the wolf, is not around.
When you have a chance, take it!
Success will be what's found.

Do not join the herd
Do not become a sheep
Try to stay awake
When the others are asleep.

I kick the earth beneath my feet
as I walk towards my flock of sheep.
Snow, it came in force last night
(my bedroom door was frozen tight).
Yet, as I woke, I thought of them.
How many did the cold condemn?

A shepherd? That I call myself.
Yet, I've laid my crook upon the shelf.
I read in tales of shepherds grand.
I'm no more a shepherd than a man.
I sleep in warmth and they in cold.
Of me, no stories shall be told.

And I do believe I am a fool.
I go on about "I am so cruel"
The pasture finds them sleeping well.
So quick to say what had befell.
No, I am no shepherd, just a fool.
I forgot that sheep are dressed in wool.

We all have wolves,
Hidden beneath our sheep.
A smile concealing
The debilitating anguish
That consumes every cell.

Laughter choking the soul
With vines of self loathing and contempt.
Enduring every second of
Soul shredding agony
Thinking of you bestows
Upon me.

The ghost of your love
Haunting every thought.
Blades slicing every inch of flesh
bleeding me dry would be
Welcomed.

If only to forget you...
For only a moment...

We can all dream of love night and day.
A dream lover.
To dream alone.
Is so much better.
In the cold of the night.
Love is a fossil.
Crispy dry and decayed.

Put love.
My once friend.
Love out to pasture.
In the field of dreams.
Sheep get counted.

Their fleeces, 
they don't fleece the dreamer.
Drift down the river of dreams.
In life
one is always
balancing

like we juggle our mothers
against our fathers

or one teacher
against another
(only to balance our grade average) 

3 grains of salt
to one ounce truth

our sweet black essence
or the funky honkies down the street

and lately i've begun wondering
if you're trying to tell me something

we used to talk all night
and do things alone together

and i've begun

(as a reaction to a feeling) 
to balance
the pleasure of loneliness
against the pain
of loving you
Baa baa black sheep...
Once a little lamb.
Grew into an adult sheep.
Then became a man.
Sheep, one, two,three...
Slip slip slip...
Into Zzzzzzzzzzzz

The sheep were  in the pen, sheltered for the night
we then sat around the log fire to chat till we fall asleep,
under the open sky ,in a clearing on a wintry night.

Contrary to  what I gathered, he was full of life,
there weren't  any lines of worry, nor his face woebegone.
The heardsman looked cheery, humming tunes he loved aloud
which the pesky mountain wind, snatched and spread too soon.

I quiz  him about his treks to find pastures for the herd,
"Isn't it a task tiring , in the rough mountain terrain?"

"It's not me who leads the hungry herd to the pastures" he says
"As it is made the world to believe by those never had seen a pasture
The sheep know where the grass in green, and find the shortest path,
as pleasing them is my only wish , I dutifully follow their lead."

Normal is over rated, 
that's walking with the herd....

I'm no sheep of woolly needs 
I walk a field of individuality...

I feed on truth on the evidence that feeds knowledge,
I'll never be a sheep that follows a herd....

Farm boys wild to couple
With anything with soft-wooded trees
With mounds of earth mounds
Of pine straw will keep themselves off
Animals by legends of their own: 
In the hay-tunnel dark
And dung of barns, they will
Say I have heard tell

That in a museum in Atlanta
Way back in a corner somewhere
There's this thing that's only half
Sheep like a woolly baby
Pickled in alcohol because
Those things can't live his eyes
Are open but you can't stand to look
I heard from somebody who...

But this is now almost all
Gone. The boys have taken
Their own true wives in the city, 
The sheep are safe in the west hill
Pasture but we who were born there
Still are not sure. Are we, 
Because we remember, remembered
In the terrible dust of museums? 

Merely with his eyes, the sheep-child may
Be saying saying

I am here, in my father's house.
I who am half of your world, came deeply
To my mother in the long grass
Of the west pasture, where she stood like moonlight
Listening for foxes. It was something like love
From another world that seized her
From behind, and she gave, not Iifting her head
Out of dew, without ever looking, her best
Self to that great need. Turned loose, she dipped her face
Farther into the chill of the earth, and in a sound
Of sobbing of something stumbling
Away, began, as she must do, 
To carry me. I woke, dying, 
In the summer sun of the hillside, with my eyes
Far more than human. I saw for a blazing moment
The great grassy world from both sides, 
Man and beast in the round of their need, 
And the hill wind stirred in my wool, 
My hoof and my hand clasped each other, 
I ate my one meal
Of milk, and died
Staring. From dark grass I came straight

To my father's house, whose dust
Whirls up in the halls for no reason
When no one comes piling deep in a hellish mild
corner, 
And, through my immortal waters, 
I meet the sun's grains eye
To eye, and they fail at my closet of glass.
Dead, I am most surely living
In the minds of farm boys: I am he who drives
Them like wolves from the hound bitch and calf
And from the chaste ewe in the wind.
They go into woods into bean fields they go
Deep into their known right hands. Dreaming of me, 
They groan they wait they suffer
Themselves, they marry, they raise their kind. 
I have always been one to make sacrifices. 
I am not bitter, it is just how my life has played out.
Just like Pavlov's dogs, I have been trained
that one stimulus warrants a specific outcome.
This time, instead of a bell and food
my experiment relates to selfish thinking and punishment.
Classical conditioning has a stranglehold on me, 
to the point where I feel guilty about any indulgences
or even asking for anything. In a world of "me first"
I am a sheep among wolves, trying not to get devoured.

I sit on the new mown grass, 
even though it’s hard to get back up,
because the smell is intoxicating.
The maple tree I rest my back against
is wide, sturdy, and rigid.
I watch, as the dog listens. 
Runs.
Turns on a dime.
He is in his element - 
the sheep are his focus, 
the man’s voice, his guide.
The sheep are on a full run.
Away.  Come bye.  Walk on.  That’ll do.
Resting, panting, watching,
Waiting for the next time to go to work
and fly like the wind.
In her room at the prow of the house
Where light breaks, and the windows are tossed with linden,
My daughter is writing a story.

I pause in the stairwell, hearing
From her shut door a commotion of typewriter-keys
Like a chain hauled over a gunwale.

Young as she is, the stuff
Of her life is a great cargo, and some of it heavy:
I wish her a lucky passage.

But now it is she who pauses,
As if to reject my thought and its easy figure.
A stillness greatens, in which

The whole house seems to be thinking,
And then she is at it again with a bunched clamor
Of strokes, and again is silent.

I remember the dazed starling
Which was trapped in that very room, two years ago;
How we stole in, lifted a sash

And retreated, not to affright it;
And how for a helpless hour, through the crack of the door,
We watched the sleek, wild, dark

And iridescent creature
Batter against the brilliance, drop like a glove
To the hard floor, or the desk-top,

And wait then, humped and bloody,
For the wits to try it again; and how our spirits
Rose when, suddenly sure,

It lifted off from a chair-back, 
Beating a smooth course for the right window
And clearing the sill of the world.

It is always a matter, my darling,
Of life or death, as I had forgotten. I wish
What I wished you before, but harder.
Counting sheep one, two, six at a time
Wishing I could sleep just to get away from time
Lying here yawning as the world flies by
I wonder if anyone knows that eventually they'll die
Resting in a search for some peace and quiet
I take a break from my television diet
What if the whole world came to a halt?
Would it learn anything new? Or would it just keep doing the same old thing?

Ask yourself, are you The Lion or the Sheep?
You call yourself the King of the Jungle,
However, the jungle is not your resting place.
Is that not ironic?

If home is not a home,
Than it is as empty as the grassy fields you roam.
A Sheep knows its role – to feed be fed upon.
Yet, a Lion hunts less then he lets on.
Humility is scarce, far more than his prey.
A predator should be humble or next to nothing he’ll lay.
At the top of the food chain links can still be broken
If too much pride is spoken, it’ll leave messages unheard.
Your strengths are dependent on the perception of others.
Brothers are among you,
Your choice is to follow or lead.
The Hunter or the Hunted,
The Lion or the Sheep.
I should have known, when I undid his chain,
That darkness had been busy at his brain
As at an anvil, sharpening a fang. 
I should have known it by the glint that sprang
Into his eyes when the chain fell and he
Stood stiffly there, as though to let me see
That he had all the time in the world to spare,
If I so felt, to match me stare for stare,
His heart being innocent.

I watched him go
Out through the gate with just the slightest show
Of hurry in his trot, as though he kept
His body back from where his thoughts leapt
Ahead to the red kill; that holding back
A dog will never show unless the track
He follows is a secret he would keep 
From men whose fingers smell of lambs and sheep.

I should have known, had I but had the eye,
That strain in hip and curving flank and thigh
For what must happen in a hawk's neck when
He spots the quail way down there, but with men
Too near in yard or paddock to make safe
The whistling lunge; the tension of that chafe
That is when lust has the red tongue on fire
But cunning is the muzzle on desire. 

So he went slowly till I lost him quite
In the thick fog that made another night
Over the paddocks where beneath the trees
The lambs would be hard at it on their knees
Draining the heavy udders. In that fog
A lamb would learn the coming of a dog
Too late even to get upon its feet, 
Or in one wild and lost and desperate bleat
To say that death was hard and life was sweet.

He got his fifty in a mile that day, 
Crunched through the shoulders in the killer's way,
Ribs broken in to crush the leaping heart.
Though great my loss, I recognized the art
With which the thing was done. What speed, what power,
He must have known for that one breathless hour,
When long restraint was straw before the urge
Of instinct, the red longing, the hot surge
That leapt and thundered and would not be still
Till fifty lambs lay dead about the hill!

He always liked to work the sheep close in,
Sniffing the blood, no doubt, beneath the skin
He dared not tear because of watching eyes.
Why did I trust that shifty compromise!
Why must sheep stand, by fear together drifted,
Helpless as flowers when the scythe is lifted!
Who was at fault, the dog, or I, or the sheep?

But since a farmer needs must have his sleep,
That night I put a bullet in his head,
Gave the world back to God, and went to bed. 
I planted an idea in your mind
with my eyes
I pulled wool over your head and heart 
with my lies
I carried you along my stories
so sweet
I made a small trail, leaving hints
with each treat
you followed behind
eager for more
and had not a clue
what plans were in store
deep in the dark
lost in the wood
there is no safety
no creatures of good
once you are alone
what a feast I will eat
for I am the wolf
and now you're my sheep.

I had one last visit with
Daddy before he died.
Before leaving 
I asked 
If I could do anything for him.
I was shocked when I heard:
"Feed my sheep."
My friend was closer to him and heard:
"Clean my teeth."
Not quite the same as Camus'
Deathbed pronouncement.
His corpse had an existential smile.

Amid the tamarind trees
There goes a flock of sheep

Shaking heads
Jumping merrily
Hither and thither

Behold!  there, one man becomes
A flock of sheep

Evolving in to
A black little lamb,
A mother sheep munching on paper
And a goat kicking another one
Among the group

There! a flock of sheep
That has turned in to a man! 

Where on earth
Are you? 
Wails the flock of sheep
Bleating be..........be......teasingly
Tongue brushing  ear lobes
with ruminating saliva

Beside that flock of sheep,
Dragging along a wounded right leg,
Staring at the sky
Standing transfixed,
The shepherd was the other person

He was a memory
Of having been a flock of sheep once...
On each path he treads
A thousand flocks of sheep passes
In joy and mirth

Despite being poor at herding
The one who happened to stop by
Bumping on a lamb that fell down

The photostat of a goat
With burned legs

Lying in the womb of a pregnant sheep
He is sleeping...
Byways and bygone
And lone nights long
Sun rays and sea waves
And star and stone

Manless and friendless
No cave my home
This is my torture
My long nights, lone
Looking at each bird
That flew across the sky
He laments
That they are his lost sheep
Beckoning the crows, sparrows and parrots

The birds in turn fly away
Frightened
As though seeing a hunter

The stick he held
Was mistaken for an arrow
Piercing the ground

His prayers, 
Not to let them fall
In to the lakes of the sky
Was blocked by the clouds...

I tried counting sheep,
but they were all 
nestled together -
in a bundle of wool 
and dreams -
taunting me in their 
slumber,
teasing me in 
dormancy. 
So I laid there 
and thought,
and spoke to myself,
and dreamed 
of a restful night.

Wind
swaying outside
the window
saying that
the sheep are clouds that
couldn't resist the temptation of
green
so they had no choice but to
fall
down
to earth.﻿

I am not a sheep
I am not a lamb
I will not docilate our race
That's just the way I am. 

Humanity is a strange beast
we claim to be the sheep,
But for our Shepherd we do not weep

We are a pack
Not a herd
Upon the weak we feed
Not upon those whom might attack. 
There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, 
There is a rapture on the lonely shore, 
There is society, where none intrudes, 
By the deep sea, and music in its roar: 
I love not man the less, but Nature more, 
From these our interviews, in which I steal 
From all I may be, or have been before, 
To mingle with the Universe, and feel 
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
So to call us a sheep
Is really quite absurd
For at least a sheep
Is safe in its loving herd
In her room at the prow of the house
Where light breaks, and the windows are tossed with linden,
My daughter is writing a story.

I pause in the stairwell, hearing
From her shut door a commotion of typewriter-keys
Like a chain hauled over a gunwale.

Young as she is, the stuff
Of her life is a great cargo, and some of it heavy:
I wish her a lucky passage.

But now it is she who pauses,
As if to reject my thought and its easy figure.
A stillness greatens, in which

The whole house seems to be thinking,
And then she is at it again with a bunched clamor
Of strokes, and again is silent.

I remember the dazed starling
Which was trapped in that very room, two years ago;
How we stole in, lifted a sash

And retreated, not to affright it;
And how for a helpless hour, through the crack of the door,
We watched the sleek, wild, dark

And iridescent creature
Batter against the brilliance, drop like a glove
To the hard floor, or the desk-top,

And wait then, humped and bloody,
For the wits to try it again; and how our spirits
Rose when, suddenly sure,

It lifted off from a chair-back, 
Beating a smooth course for the right window
And clearing the sill of the world.
All things within this fading world hath end,
Adversity doth still our joys attend;
No ties so strong, no friends so dear and sweet,
But with death's parting blow are sure to meet.
The sentence past is most irrevocable,
A common thing, yet oh, inevitable.
How soon, my Dear, death may my steps attend,
How soon't may be thy lot to lose thy friend,
We both are ignorant, yet love bids me
These farewell lines to recommend to thee,
That when the knot's untied that made us one,
I may seem thine, who in effect am none.
And if I see not half my days that's due,
What nature would, God grant to yours and you;
The many faults that well you know I have
Let be interred in my oblivious grave;
If any worth or virtue were in me,
Let that live freshly in thy memory
And when thou feel'st no grief, as I no harmes,
Yet love thy dead, who long lay in thine arms,
And when thy loss shall be repaid with gains
Look to my little babes, my dear remains.
And if thou love thyself, or loved'st me,
These O protect from stepdame's injury.
And if chance to thine eyes shall bring this verse,
With some sad sighs honor my absent hearse;
And kiss this paper for thy dear love's sake, 
Who with salt tears this last farewell did take.
It is always a matter, my darling,
Of life or death, as I had forgotten. I wish
What I wished you before, but harder.
Kiss me softly
As I drift asleep.
Play with my hair
As I start to count sheep.
One. Two. Three. Four. Fi-
Kiss me sweetly
As you watch me drift away.
Let us rest together
All night, until day.
Kiss me gently
I want to wake in your scent.
A night like that
Is a night well spent.
-ve. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.
Kiss me strongly
Pull me in, close to you.
We'll get each other's name
As a rib cage tattoo.
Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thir-
Lay with me every night
As I fall asleep.
And help me to 
Keep counting those sheep.

its a tidal river,
the sea water comes in to the bridge,
where they used to build boats.
the river full and still, mid flow,
i watched and looked early,
i noted the sheep tracks where we run,
parallel.

‘don’t jump’, he said, as if i would,
the grave digger, grinning,
‘ happy new year’
and the same to you, angel.

years ago,
i may have jumped,
after you buried him.

its those like you,
that see the beauty of the river,
where the seal comes to play,
and the tide goes up to the bridge.

so we laugh and wave,
and go on our way
up to the bridge.

the flock
the oblivious, idiotic flock
oh, simple sheep
what do you think you see?
a flower?
a bird?
the vibrant rays of the sun?
you romanticize the dark
you believe you can bring light
to the pits of the shadows
but, you're foolish
look closer
and, Death will show herself

Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow
Baa baa black sheep have you any wool
-
The white is stained by the
Black of my stained purity
-
These are the tales I'll tell my children
I'll say beware the wolf
Don't trust
Don't love
Guard yourself
Don't leave the trail
Stay in the light
Don't let anyone near
Guard your garden of roses and violets
Keep your sheep in the field
Violets
Roses
Sheep
Wolves
I found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
On a white heal-all, holding up a moth
Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth --
Assorted characters of death and blight
Mixed ready to begin the morning right,
Like the ingredients of a witches' broth --
A snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,
And dead wings carried like a paper kite.

What had that flower to do with being white,
The wayside blue and innocent heal-all?
What brought the kindred spider to that height,
Then steered the white moth thither in the night?
What but design of darkness to appall?--
If design govern in a thing so small.
I'm only lukewarm, marginally mediocre.
Not quite laid-back enough to be considered cool
Nor adequately exciting for red hot.
Just going by, average, as a rule.
I'm much too old to be reckless and immature,
Yet not as old as wisdom and a good war story.
Not so rich to live out luxurious abandon
but far too rich to be tragically sorry.
I'm unremarkable, uneventful, uninteresting,
Uncool and unattractive, unfit and unaware.
I assume I'm just not- I'm everything 'un' already,
A stale glass of water, gone oddly warm in stagnant air
I am lukewarm, at best.
Perhaps some day I'll be blast frozen
Or I had once been boiled hot.
For now though, there are no cubes of ice
That I can swallow and be more than not.
I am the everyday masses, lost in the throng,
The not-particularly-bright, non-slacker, no-name brands
That believe they're not good enough- or quite the sharpest prong.
We, the herd lost in the middle bench lands-
We're wild and we're sober,
Frightened and unafraid.
We're nothing like you, but we're just the same.
But we, the ones who spend our lives
In the middle bench,
will be alright.
We can persevere, we can.

No lot could be sadder than mine

I was defeated by my own shadow:

My words took vengeance on me.

Forgive me, reader, good reader

If I cannot leave you

With a warm embrace, I leave you

With a forced and sad smile.

Maybe that’s all I am

But listen to my last word:

I take back everything I’ve said.

With the greatest bitterness in the world

I take back everything I’ve said.

i am a sheep of the blackest
shade. 
and my sisters,
wooly white angels 
in bleached mohair. 
me i could do no good.
me bad through to the core. 
them angelic, pure.
at least that's what, everybody,
thought they saw

girl, i am a member of the black sheep clan
In one diffusive band,
They drive the troubled flocks, by many a dog
Compell'd to where the mazy-running brook
Forms a deep pool; this bank abrupt and high,
And that fair-spreading in a pebbled shore,
Urged to the giddy brink, much is the toil,
The clamour much, of men, and boys, and dogs,
Ere the soft fearful people to the flood
Commit their woolly sides. And oft the swain,
On some impatient seizing, hurls them in:
Embolden'd, then, nor hesitating more,
Fast, fast they plunge amid the flashing wave,
And, panting, labour to the farther shore.
Repeated this, till deep the well-wash'd fleece
Has drunk the flood, and from his lively haunt
The trout is banish'd by the sordid stream;
Heavy and dripping, to the breezy brow
Slow move the harmless race: where, as they spread
Inly disturbed, and wondering what this wild
Outrageous tumult means, their loud complaints
The coutry fill; and, toss'd from rock to rock,
Incessant bleatings run around the hills.
At last, of snowy white, the gather'd flocks
Are in the wattled pen innumerous press'd,
Head above head: and, ranged in lusty rows,
The shepherds sit, and whet the sounding shears,
The housewife waits to roll her fleecy stores,
With all her gay-dress'd maids attending round.
One chief, in gracious dignity enthroned,
Shines o'er the rest, the pastoral queen, and rays
Her smiles, sweet-beaming, on her shepherd-king:
While the glad circle round them yield their souls
To festive mirth, and wit that knows no gall. 
Meantime their joyous task goes on apace;
Some, mingling stir the melted tar, and some,
Deep on the new-shorn vagrant's heaving side,
To stamp the master's cipher ready stand;
Others th' unwilling wether drag along; 
And, glorying in his might, the sturdy boy
Holds by the twisted horns the indignant ram.
Behold where bound, and of its robe bereft
By needy man, that all-depending lord,
How meek, how patient, the mild creature lies! 
What softness in its melancholy face,
What dumb complaining innocence appears!
Fear not, ye gentle tribes, 'tis not the knife
Of horrid slaughter that is o'er you waved;
No, 'tis the tender swain's well-guided shears,
Who having now, to pay his annual care,
Borrow'd your fleece, to you a cumbrous load,
Will send you bounding to your hills again. 
my feet have always had,
a need to be elsewhere. 
Dad called it my infernal wanderlust... 
so, i have heeded their call.
travelled far and wide,
finding love in ports everywhere,
but none for to be my bride.

girl, i am a member of the black sheep clan.

always moving forward,
so i don't have to...
look behind.
but still,
self recrimination 
is a constant bedfellow 
of mine.
you know, it takes years,
of dedicated time and headspace.
to become a man,
beyond, his prime.

girl, i am a member of the black sheep clan.

a merry, meticullous fuck-up.
who can laugh, at hisself,
yet, still continue to commit  his biggest crime,
daily i kill myself....
daily i survive....
just a one man crime wave,
not worth trying to save.
but you do, you do.

girl, i am a member of the black sheep clan.
The mind, the core of ones being
some use it well, others neglect it 
they are called sheeple
they bleet and baa, grazing in their 
banal little worlds, finding distain 
with those that arent like them, 
Ahh, but some may look like them 
but they are like you and I, 
lovely Wolves, intelligent and oh so hungry
They wait with watchful patience, 
not really interested in the bleetings of idiots
but determined to aquire their prey 
Beautiful vibrant minds that see the real meaning
of everything around them, they wait for their time
Their time of revolution, evolution.
The sheeple are content to stare blankly at anything 
that takes their minds off the emptyness of their lives, 
their vacuous religions and that faux thing they call 'love'.
They may pray to some unseen deity, but their real gods 
color is green, the one they would die for, and do daily.
Pathetic simpletons with no purpose other than to line the 
pockets of very wealthy Wolves, slaves to almighty 
corporate creed, it is here that I praise it, for they use the 
sheeple and toss their carcasses to and fro like empty 
candy wrappers. 

Blessed be ours, The Wolves. 
motley me, 
with a jester's soul. 
trying for laughter,
but just getting more old.
lived a life, bought,
purely on fool's gold. 
now close to the hereafter and still breaking the mold.

girl, i am a member of the black sheep clan.

the Crue knew who i am.
i am just one of this world's many misunderstood.

girl i am just one member of the black sheep clan.

Drift away for me, my dear.
Sleep 'till you aren't even here.

Ease the mind, ease the heart.
Feel the will to breathe fall apart.

got caught up in blue ink
fever last night,
reading h.p. pops and wrestling
with the words.
only to find the new day at hand

so now i am sitting in a meeting of great importance.

(eyes drooping, day  dreaming,
sheep visiting- NO, don't count the bloody things, YOU FOOL!)

discusing matters of teaching and reaching decision on text,

(cotton pillows with smiles on their dials, beckon me over the fence to play with bo peeps sheep DO NOT COUNT THOSE SHEEP.)

books and performance scripts for the following  year, now is when

(sheep are such fluffy little things, you could just put your head down on their little tummies. LEAVE THE SHEEP ALONE HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU)

you make a case for new works
and differing the standard

(and there is just so many of the fuzzy little deweds, DON'T EWE DARE.  IF I HAVE TO COME OVER THERE  EWE'LL KNOW ABOUT IT!!!!!)

Bo, are you with us, I know this isn't the most exciting  discusion,
but it would be helpful if you could refrain from snoring.

(TOLD EWE!!)
Farm boys wild to couple
With anything with soft-wooded trees
With mounds of earth mounds
Of pine straw will keep themselves off
Animals by legends of their own: 
In the hay-tunnel dark
And dung of barns, they will
Say I have heard tell

That in a museum in Atlanta
Way back in a corner somewhere
There's this thing that's only half
Sheep like a woolly baby
Pickled in alcohol because
Those things can't live his eyes
Are open but you can't stand to look
I heard from somebody who...

But this is now almost all
Gone. The boys have taken
Their own true wives in the city, 
The sheep are safe in the west hill
Pasture but we who were born there
Still are not sure. Are we, 
Because we remember, remembered
In the terrible dust of museums? 

Merely with his eyes, the sheep-child may
Be saying saying

I am here, in my father's house.
I who am half of your world, came deeply
To my mother in the long grass
Of the west pasture, where she stood like moonlight
Listening for foxes. It was something like love
From another world that seized her
From behind, and she gave, not Iifting her head
Out of dew, without ever looking, her best
Self to that great need. Turned loose, she dipped her face
Farther into the chill of the earth, and in a sound
Of sobbing of something stumbling
Away, began, as she must do, 
To carry me. I woke, dying, 
In the summer sun of the hillside, with my eyes
Far more than human. I saw for a blazing moment
The great grassy world from both sides, 
Man and beast in the round of their need, 
And the hill wind stirred in my wool, 
My hoof and my hand clasped each other, 
I ate my one meal
Of milk, and died
Staring. From dark grass I came straight

To my father's house, whose dust
Whirls up in the halls for no reason
When no one comes piling deep in a hellish mild
corner, 
And, through my immortal waters, 
I meet the sun's grains eye
To eye, and they fail at my closet of glass.
Dead, I am most surely living
In the minds of farm boys: I am he who drives
Them like wolves from the hound bitch and calf
And from the chaste ewe in the wind.
They go into woods into bean fields they go
Deep into their known right hands. Dreaming of me, 
They groan they wait they suffer
Themselves, they marry, they raise their kind. 
The sheep raid my plantation
Bringing down my fences
Eating my crop's
Polluting my air, With bitter taste
Bitter and angry i become
Full of rage...

But.....

In my mind's eye
I know all can be rebuilt
The air can become fresh
And the grass green

The cycle of it all
And all comes back around.....

Again!

Think about it.....

"Go back to sleep,
close your eyes,
be a sheep, witness the lies
and please don't cry.
All will be well,
when the sun rises again.
Meanwhile, you have to
live the pain right through.
Drink the poison, like you were taught too
because better times are on the horizon..."

You tell everyone this, like they're children.
Even when there are people bleeding, over the horizon.
You fear the enquiry, your own people's word,
like a child expresses opinion: loud but afraid to be heard.
You scream and shout and do what you like,
trying to subvert the blame and failing to explain why.
All we ever get, all you ever say when cornered,
is that it's not our concern and you're looking after the world.
Better in the long run, victory on the horizon,
stalling so much I've noticed very little change in this tedium.

Generations have waited and waited
but a perfect world never surfaced.
Again you tell us not to worry, it's in our heads,
you're all trying your hardest whilst we lay in our beds.
We give you our wages, we consider you our leaders,
but you all feed us your lies and hypocrisy like corrupt dealers,
promoting your peace while endorsing war for prosperity.
It seems like when I open my eyes, I see you're the real enemy.
Why must we fight for you, to get to heaven, why must we be tested?
Why not have heaven here on Earth and stop the actions so primitive?

You say don't worry to hide the secrets from us and profit in the process.
A world where classified means secret and your word can only ever be bullshit.
Meanwhile you interpret your people's as exactly that, with dismissal.
Only realising when the sky comes crashing down and that nightmare is real.
Well I know we don't need you and I worry for our world...
As for you, you certainly should worry about the hate you build.
With you at the helm, leading us blindfold,
how do I know we're going to paradise like you told us?
It feels like we're going the wrong way,
my government, religion, ideology is leading me astray...

Speaks for itself I suppose, haha.

i guess every family has one.
i just wish it wasn't me.
no one understands,
but why's it hard to see?
that words can actually hurt
and people arent made of stone. 
no matter how hard they seem
or how much you think they've grown.
A scientist has a test tube full of sheep. He 
wonders if he should try to shrink a pasture 
for them. 
They are like grains of rice. 
He wonders if it is possible to shrink something 
out of existence. 
He wonders if the sheep are aware of their tininess, 
if they have any sense of scale. Perhaps they think 
the test tube is a glass barn ... 
He wonders what he should do with them; they 
certainly have less meat and wool than ordinary 
sheep. Has he reduced their commercial value? 
He wonders if they could be used as a substitute 
for rice, a sort of wolly rice . . . 
He wonders if he shouldn't rub them into a red paste 
between his fingers. 
He wonders if they are breeding, or if any of them 
have died. 
He puts them under a microscope, and falls asleep 
counting them
i turned off the
fan in my room
because summer
is over and the
silence was
deafening
every click
and whir every
noise my body made
could be heard and 
there you were at
11:56 in the 
middle of a dream
there you were, whispering
to me

I claimed you in severity
in illegitimacy 
how could I ever forget
that you were my father
before anyone else
I am lost and
you are the
only one
who can
find 
me.
The ring is on my hand,
And the wreath is on my brow;
Satin and jewels grand
Are all at my command,
And I am happy now.

And my lord he loves me well;
But, when first he breathed his vow,
I felt my bosom swell-
For the words rang as a knell,
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell,
And who is happy now.

But he spoke to re-assure me,
And he kissed my pallid brow,
While a reverie came o'er me,
And to the church-yard bore me,
And I sighed to him before me,
Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
"Oh, I am happy now!"

And thus the words were spoken,
And this the plighted vow,
And, though my faith be broken,
And, though my heart be broken,
Here is a ring, as token
That I am happy now!

Would God I could awaken!
For I dream I know not how!
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest an evil step be taken,-
Lest the dead who is forsaken
May not be happy now.
Tossing and turning
Spinning and yearning
Flowing and fusing
Loving and leaving

Does this feel?
Does that hurt?
Does it flow?
Is it dirt?
All in the April evening, 
April airs were abroad; 
The sheep with their little lambs 
Passed me by on the road. 

The sheep with their little lambs 
Passed me by on the road; 
All in the April evening 
I thought on the Lamb of God. 

The lambs were weary and crying 
With a weak, human cry.
I thought on the Lamb of God 
Going meekly to die. 

Up in the blue, blue mountains 
Dewy pastures are sweet; 
Rest for the little bodies, 
Rest for the little feet. 

But for the Lamb of God, 
Up on the hill-top green, 
Only a Cross of shame 
Two stark crosses between. 

All in the April evening, 
April airs were abroad; 
I saw the sheep with their lambs, 
And thought on the Lamb of God. 
We're following along like lost little sheep
We don't stop and think
We're so obsessed with being different
We end up all the same
Escape me?
Never---
Beloved!
While I am I, and you are you,
So long as the world contains us both,
Me the loving and you the loth
While the one eludes, must the other pursue. 
My life is a fault at last, I fear:
It seems too much like a fate, indeed!
Though I do my best I shall scarce succeed.
But what if I fail of my purpose here?
It is but to keep the nerves at strain,
To dry one's eyes and laugh at a fall,
And, baffled, get up and begin again,---
So the chace takes up one's life ' that's all. 
While, look but once from your farthest bound
At me so deep in the dust and dark,
No sooner the old hope goes to ground
Than a new one, straight to the self-same mark,
I shape me---
Ever
Removed!
Spending a lifetime playing follow the leader
Calling the ones who branch off a cheater

Like small children on the playground
Playing games with useless rules
"Tag your dead!"
Is all I hear
All I feel
All I see
Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness, 
Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
Of deities or mortals, or of both,
In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
For ever piping songs for ever new;
More happy love! more happy, happy love!
For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,
For ever panting, and for ever young;
All breathing human passion far above,
That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
What little town by river or sea shore,
Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
And, little town, thy streets for evermore
Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.

O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
With forest branches and the trodden weed;
Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
When old age shall this generation waste,
Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,
"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."
But I try to change it
To feel it
To steal my own way along the road

I'll take the long way if I can make it my own
I'll see you at the end with a smile on my face
While you wash the blood off of yours

Even if its harder or wrong
At least I can always say I did it on my own...

I have a closet full of spiral notebooks that contradict each other
Each one a piece of me that I don't want to remember
The chicken scratch of sleepless nights and unstable letters
And I have no intention of pulling them all together

My pencils are in fragments and my pens have all bled out
So I paint pictures with my self destruction and my self doubt
And while my star has burned bright but now its nearly burnt out
There's a fire in the attic and I'm spaced out on the couch

The black sheep is back in town and missed none of you at all
Accepted on himself all the cracks in that cell wall
His words sit collecting dust in a blackbird's drawl
Eyes wide open with a smile 'till the white horizon falls

I found myself surrounded not
by wolves in sheep's clothing 
but sheep in wolves clothing
To hear false claims of independent
minds, separate wills, strong souls
Yet quick to follow the command of
someone. 
The excuse is friendship, love.
The same promise that was given to me.
Do not insult the heart of a wolf
with lies of it's identity.
Be true to yourself sheep.
Be safe with your flock.
Follow what you know.

twenty two, twenty three, twenty four

hours in a day

like the white rabbit,

we watch time and stay at the bay.



ten, eight, six, four

words like ‘it’s not good enough,’

or maybe just simple and badly-woven adjectives,

sometimes it makes us feel blue.



thirty, sixty two, countless

nights spent dreaming with open eyes

but all that comes are unkind;

worse than reality’s piercing swords of ice.



yellow, red, blue, nonexistent.

what we know is counting down

to the day the string snaps

the insides spilled; to everyone, its uglies shown.



three, nine, twenty seven

years spent as busy as a cat on a hot tin roof;

the forgotten summers fell into piles of ashes,

yet to our bars of efforts, everyone stays aloof.



one too many times

it happens.

one too many days we thought

fuck it up.



(so we did.)



six,five, four

ages we were taught numbers and their orders.

nowadays, fuck it up and

count sheep throughout math.
The pockets of our greatcoats full of barley...
No kitchens on the run, no striking camp...
We moved quick and sudden in our own country.
The priest lay behind ditches with the tramp.
A people hardly marching... on the hike...
We found new tactics happening each day: 
We'd cut through reins and rider with the pike
And stampede cattle into infantry, 
Then retreat through hedges where cavalry must be thrown.
Until... on Vinegar Hill... the final conclave.
Terraced thousands died, shaking scythes at cannon.
The hillside blushed, soaked in our broken wave.
They buried us without shroud or coffin
And in August... the barley grew up out of our grave.
I let them tangle together
And I flow securely on the wind
I am free

I am free 
Like a bird
Soaring over the mountains

Soaring over the mountains
While you're down 
On the ground
Herding sheep

going to bed while I'm full of dread
too many bad thoughts in my head
as I drift off into the deep
I see images of dying sheep
waking up sweating, pain in my chest
it makes it hard for my mind to rest
the only hope that I keep
is gently dying in my sleep

You told me I'm a lion,
That concerns itself much too often
With the opinions of sheep.

I worry too much,
Let's be honest.
I apologize too much,
And it hurts not to say sorry for that.

I am afraid
Almost constantly,
But overcoming my fear
Drives me
To be
Who I am.

If I am a lioness,
I am a queen,
And then I ask of you,
With a crack in the demand of my voice,
Be my king?

You claim I could not hurt a fly,
I could not hurt a soul,
But it is a choice,
Can't you tell?
To sheathe my claws
And not bare my teeth.

I could choose to be vicious,
I could choose to be cruel,
But vapid venom has no interest to me.

I choose to show weakness,
I choose to be vulnerable,
I choose to be
The me I accept.

Maybe I shouldn't concern myself
With the opinions of sheep,
But some sheep are wolves.

Though,
I suppose,
With the king of the jungle
At my side,
There's no need to fear
A pup that's too big for his britches.

I can't sleep
Because I can't find silence.
And I can't find equanimity.
You're breathing heavy 
But it's nice to hear you're alive.

Speak of the Devil,
and he shall appear,
but cower, not of his evil.
Demons are nothing to fear!

They're concealed by corners,
and skulk beneath shadows.
But hear me, fellow Loners:
These are not the Gallows!

No! There is no danger here!
Only men behind masks,
that hide their own tears!
Just listen, is all that I ask.
I should have known, when I undid his chain,
That darkness had been busy at his brain
As at an anvil, sharpening a fang. 
I should have known it by the glint that sprang
Into his eyes when the chain fell and he
Stood stiffly there, as though to let me see
That he had all the time in the world to spare,
If I so felt, to match me stare for stare,
His heart being innocent.

I watched him go
Out through the gate with just the slightest show
Of hurry in his trot, as though he kept
His body back from where his thoughts leapt
Ahead to the red kill; that holding back
A dog will never show unless the track
He follows is a secret he would keep 
From men whose fingers smell of lambs and sheep.

I should have known, had I but had the eye,
That strain in hip and curving flank and thigh
For what must happen in a hawk's neck when
He spots the quail way down there, but with men
Too near in yard or paddock to make safe
The whistling lunge; the tension of that chafe
That is when lust has the red tongue on fire
But cunning is the muzzle on desire. 

So he went slowly till I lost him quite
In the thick fog that made another night
Over the paddocks where beneath the trees
The lambs would be hard at it on their knees
Draining the heavy udders. In that fog
A lamb would learn the coming of a dog
Too late even to get upon its feet, 
Or in one wild and lost and desperate bleat
To say that death was hard and life was sweet.

He got his fifty in a mile that day, 
Crunched through the shoulders in the killer's way,
Ribs broken in to crush the leaping heart.
Though great my loss, I recognized the art
With which the thing was done. What speed, what power,
He must have known for that one breathless hour,
When long restraint was straw before the urge
Of instinct, the red longing, the hot surge
That leapt and thundered and would not be still
Till fifty lambs lay dead about the hill!

He always liked to work the sheep close in,
Sniffing the blood, no doubt, beneath the skin
He dared not tear because of watching eyes.
Why did I trust that shifty compromise!
Why must sheep stand, by fear together drifted,
Helpless as flowers when the scythe is lifted!
Who was at fault, the dog, or I, or the sheep?

But since a farmer needs must have his sleep,
That night I put a bullet in his head,
Gave the world back to God, and went to bed. 
Demons are aplenty,
but they've no hold
over the Sheep so gently
grazing in their folds!

My Flock, speak their names,
then laugh in their faces!
They play pathetic games,
but cannot win our graces!

They are the weak and scorned,
for they have not our hearts!
From egotistical ambiguities they are born--
our confidence tears them apart!

So, I say to you, my friends:
walk through their Valleys and Shadows of Death,
but do no let it be your ends!
Do not let them steal away your breath!

Angelic minds deflowered
By the ice cream in hell
Now master becomes servant
With sandwich board and bell
No one wants damaged goods
They’ll put you under a spell
Of shame, flames, and runaway trains
And secrets not to tell
I'll sing you a poem of a silly young king
Who played with the world at the end of a string,
But he only loved one single thing—
And that was just a peanut-butter sandwich.
His scepter and his royal gowns,
His regal throne and golden crowns
Were brown and sticky from the mounds
And drippings from each peanut-butter sandwich.
His subjects all were silly fools
For he had passed a royal rule
That all that they could learn in school
Was how to make a peanut-butter sandwich.
He would not eat his sovereign steak,
He scorned his soup and kingly cake,
And told his courtly cook to bake
An extra-sticky peanut-butter sandwich.
And then one day he took a bit
And started chewing with delight,
But found his mouth was stuck quite tight
From that last bite of peanut-butter sandwich.
His brother pulled, his sister pried,
The wizard pushed, his mother cried,
'My boy's committed suicide
From eating his last peanut-butter sandwich!'
The dentist came, and the royal doc.
The royal plumber banged and knocked,
But still those jaws stayed tightly locked.
Oh darn that sticky peanut-butter sandwich!
The carpenter, he tried with pliers,
The telephone man tried with wires,
The firemen, they tried with fire,
But couldn't melt that peanut-butter sandwich.
With ropes and pulleys, drills and coil,
With steam and lubricating oil—
For twenty years of tears and toil—
They fought that awful peanut-butter sandwich.
Then all his royal subjects came.
They hooked his jaws with grapplin' chains
And pulled both ways with might and main
Against that stubborn peanut-butter sandwich.
Each man and woman, girl and boy
Put down their ploughs and pots and toys
And pulled until kerack! Oh, joy—
They broke right through that peanut-butter sandwich
A puff of dust, a screech, a squeak—
The king's jaw opened with a creak.
And then in voice so faint and weak—
The first words that they heard him speak
Were, 'How about a peanut-butter sandwich?'
Fall back into the rhythm, love
Fall upwards to the sky
Forget the sword and rose, love
Your heart will get you by
Fall forward into sin, love
Rise downwards to the earth
Forget the author of these words
Your death triumphs your birth
Who has the tigers and who the sheep

never seems to make any difference.

The result is always the same:

She wins,

I lose.

But sometimes when her tigers

are on the rampage,

and I've lost half my herd of sheep,

help comes from unexpected quarters:

Above.

The Rusty Shield Bearer,

neutral till then,

para-drops a winning flower —

yellow

and irrelevant —

on the checkerboard

drawn on the pavement in charcoal,

cutting off the retreat

of one tiger,

and giving a check to the other;

and quickly follows it up

with another flower —

just as yellow

and just as irrelevant — except

that it comes down even more slowly;

a flower without a search warrant

that brushes past her earlobe,

grazes her cheek,

and disappears down the front

of her low-cut blouse —

where she usually keeps

her stash of hash —

to confuse her even further, with its mildly

narcotic

but very distracting fragrance. 
I am
A wolf among the sheep

They walk noisily about
Silently I creep

I walk as they do
I wear the same clothes

I meander my way through them
My prey will never know

The real me isn't so grand
This costume I wear is part of my plan

I'm not here to help you
I don't want your love

I am going to eat you
With teeth stained in blood

I stumbled upon a chapel last night 
Inside was a man with a mirrored face gesturing for me to enter 
He does not speak but continues to motion and reflect my demeanour  
Hesitant to oblige, I survey the inner-workings of the religious structure 
No where in my sight lies the truth 
A building built on lies and stories 
Fables and myths  
The man says " You feel lost little sheep, please flock to the power, for I am you, no longer shall you scour, you found yourself within these walls" 
I reply  
" You are not me, you are a just a reflection, A manifestation caused by fears and I will make peace with what I am by searching inside of me  
Not flocking like sheep to a fabled entity"

its a tidal river,

the sea water comes in to the bridge,

where they used to build boats.

the river full and still, mid flow,

i watched and looked early,

i noted the sheep tracks where we run,

parallel.

‘don’t jump’, he said, as if i would,

the grave digger, grinning,

‘ happy new year’

and the same to you, angel.

5 years ago,

i may have jumped,

after you buried him.

its those like you,

that see the beauty of the river,

where the seal comes to play,

and the tide goes up to the bridge.

so we laugh and wave,

and go on our way

up to the bridge.

From where I stand the sheep stand still
As stones against the stony hill.

The stones are gray
And so are they.

And both are weatherworn and round,
Leading the eye back to the ground.

Two mingled flocks -
The sheep, the rocks.

And still no sheep stirs from its place
Or lifts its Babylonian face. 
Never ceases to amaze.
The mentality of the masses,
Their world in a daze.

Devoid of all nerve.
Following orders blindly, 
Happy to serve.

I lie awake each night
and sleep it seems so far away.
I need to catch some sleep tonight
not sleep the day away.

But doing it is easier to say
than to get done.
just lying in the darkness
really isn't any fun.

The harder that you try to sleep
the more you stay awake.
In the morning when you leave your bed
you feel you've had no break.

You feel all the aches and pains
that your sleep should repair
and not only are you knackered,
you're also sporting tangled hair.

The day will soon be calling you
and raise you into action
but anything you do today
will not bring any satisfaction.
Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long,
Singing a song,
In search of Eldorado.
their folded mates they wander far, 
Their ways seem harsh and wild: 
They follow the beck of a baleful star, 
Their paths are dream-beguiled. 

Yet haply they sought but a wider range, 
Some loftier mountain slope, 
And little recked of the country strange 
Beyond the gates of hope. 

And haply a bell with a luring call 
Summoned their feet to tread 
Midst the cruel rocks, where the deep pitfall 
And the lurking snare are spread. 

Maybe, in spite of their tameless days 
Of outcast liberty, 
They ’re sick at heart for the homely ways 
Where their gathered brothers be. 

And oft at night, when the plains fall dark 
And the hills loom large and dim, 
For the shepherd’s voice they mutely hark, 
And their souls go out to him.

Meanwhile, “Black sheep! black sheep!” we cry, 
Safe in the inner fold; 
And maybe they hear, and wonder why, 
And marvel, out in the cold. 
But he grew old-
This knight so bold-
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado.

And, as his strength
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow-
"Shadow," said he,
"Where can it be-
This land of Eldorado?"

"Over the Mountains
Of the Moon,
Down the Valley of the Shadow,
Ride, boldly ride,"
The shade replied-
"If you seek for Eldorado!"
So I lie here counting sheep
to set me on my way
but I've been awake all night
now I will sleep all bloody day.

The more I look around me, 
the more it seems to me
that we are Sheep
that we are asleep.

We all are like lost sheep for  Thou  God,
Thou God  loves every and each sheep and takes care for all  loved one's.
Thou God even cares for lost sheep from the group,
Thou God wants humans to leave in unity just like group of sheep
Thou God  wants human to stay in family group with love and honor.
Thou God  does not like their sheep goes away from the group.
You, my friends, and you strangers, all of you, 
Stand with me a little by the walls 
Or where the walls once were. 
The bridge was here, the city further: 
Now there is neither bridge nor town— 
A doorway where the roof is down 
Opens on a foot-worn stair 
That climbs by three steps into empty air. 
(What foot went there?) 
Nothing in this town that had a thousand steeples 
Lives now but these flocks of sheep 
Grazing the yellow grasses where the bricks lie dead beneath: 
Dogs drive them with their brutal teeth. 


Can none but sheep live where the walls go under? 
Is man’s day over and the sheep’s begun? 
And shall we sit here like the mourners on a dunghill 
Shrilling with melodious tongue— 
Disfiguring our faces with the nails of our despair? 
(What dust is this we sift upon our hair?) 
Because a world is taken from us as the camels from the man of Uz 
Shall we sit weeping for the world that was 
And curse God and so perish? 
Shall monuments be grass and sheep inherit them? 
Shall dogs rule in the rubble of the arches? 


Consider, Oh consider what we are! 
Consider what it is to be a man— 
He who makes his journey by the glimmer of a candle; 
Who discovers in his mouth, between his teeth, a word; 
Whose heart can bear the silence of the stars— that burden; 
Who comes upon his meaning in the blindness of a stone— 
A girl’s shoulder, perfectly harmonious! 


Even the talk of it would take us days together. 
Marvels men have made, Oh marvels!—and our breath 
Brief as it is: our death waiting— 
Marvels upon marvels! Works of state— 
The imagination of the shape of order! 
Works of beauty—the cedar door 
Perfectly fitted to the sill of basalt! 
Works of grace— 
The ceremony at the entering of houses, 
At the entering of lives: the bride among the torches in the shrill carouse! 


Works of soul— 
Pilgrimages through the desert to the sacred boulder: 
Through the mid night to the stroke of one! 
Works of grace! Works of wonder! 
All this have we done and more— 
And seen—what have we not seen?— 


A man beneath the sunlight in his meaning: 
A man, one man, a man alone. 


In the sinks of the earth that wanderer has gone down. 
The shadow of his mind is on the mountains. 
The word he has said is kept in the place beyond 
As the seed is kept and the earth ponders it. 
Stones—even the stones remember him: 
Even the leaves—his image is in them. 
And now because the city is a ruin in the waste of air 
We sit here and despair! 
Because the sheep graze in the dying grove 
Our day is over! 
We must end 
Because the talk around the table in the dusk has ended, 
Because the fingers of the goddesses are found 
Like marble pebbles in the gravelly ground 
And nothing answers but the jackal in the desert,— 
Because the cloud proposes, the wind says! 


Because the sheep are pastured where the staring statues lie 
We sit upon the sand in silence 
Watching the sun go and the shadows change! 


Listen, my friends, and you, all of you, strangers, 
Listen, the work of man, the work of splendor 
Never has been ended or will end. 
Even where the sheep defile the ruined stair 
And dogs are masters—even there 
One man’s finger in the dust shall trace the circle. 


Even among the ruins shall begin the work, 
Large in the level morning of the light 
And beautiful with cisterns where the water whitens, 
Rippling upon the lip of stone, and spills 
By cedar sluices into pools, and the young builders 
String their plumb lines, and the well-laid course 
Blanches its mortar in the sun, and all the morning 
Smells of wood-smoke, rope-tar, horse-sweat, pitch-pine, 
Men and the trampled mint leaves in the ditch. 


One man in the sun alone 
Walks between the silence and the stone: 
The city rises from his flesh, his bone. 
This is
The best poem ever.

Spread the word.
Tell the masses.

Just like you did with
that book,
that movie,
that game,
that series.

Just like all those,
You know this poem is
Empty.

Pretty words,
Like pretty 'vampires',
Like pretty smurf-people,
Like pretty-boys with swords,
Like pretty pictures;
Devoid of genuine meaning.

Or is this poem empty?

I suppose time will tell.
Empty things
Are lauded
By the empty-minded.

And don't you know,
Society's head is hollow?

Bleat on, sheep.
This is the best poem ever.
Sheep go 'baa', one by one.
The little hedgerow birds,
That peck along the road, regard him not.
He travels on, and in his face, his step,
His gait, is one expression; every limb,
His look and bending figure, all bespeak
A man who does not move with pain, but moves
With thought. -He is insensibly subdued
To settled quiet: he is one by whom
All effort seems forgotten; one to whom
Long patience hath such mild composure given
That patience now doth seem a thing of which
He hath no need. He is by nature led
To peace so perfect, that the young behold
With envy what the Old Man hardly feels.
it's not the colour of your wool
or your preference for the dark
it's not how you stand on the edge
even in the middle, you stand apart
it's not how you draw the wolves notice
as dark as night in the middle of the day
it's not even how you simply refuse
to just want to come and play
Little Black Sheep
your genetics are one of us
Little Black Sheep
your dissimilarity is a plus
Little Black Sheep
do you wonder why
the rest of us
are White?
Little Black Sheep
you are not a loner
You're a protector
against the night

In this darkness ment to stand
Only seeing brighter lands

The light I did pursue 
But the dark it did ensue 
Though I ran with all my might
The darkness remained right by my side

It remained like a moonless night
No guiding light
To alumminate my flight 
It wasn't right
The darkness I could not fight

In this darkness ment to stand
Only seeing brighter lands

The Sun glistening through the trees
I could almost feel the breeze
It brought me to my knees 
To pray to a God that doesn't see

He's left me to all the fears
He's never near
He's made it clear
This God only listens with a deafened ear

In this darkness ment to stand
Only seeing brighter lands

I am the sheep lost in the dark
My soul it has no spark
Only sound, song of the lark
To my voice no one will hark

Please take my eyes I no longer want to see
The nothingness in front of me
I beg of you I  plea
Imprisoned in the dark, left groping for a key

In this darkness left to stand
Forced to see the brighter lands

Spit on me with your mind
And dissect me with your eyes.
Decipher this very self, less
Orientated being that simply exists.

Plunder your skin around
My thoughts without effort or
Worry. Everyday without knowing,
Show harshly, I do not matter.
I don't mind working to earn my bread,
And I'd just as soon keep straight;
I've listened to what the preacher said
About rams and sheep at the gate;
I like to sleep in an easy bed,
But I tell you this, old mate:
A man like me, what you call a Bo,
Can blister and sweat and save
All his life, and earn just enough of dough
To prove that he is a slave,
And have, when it comes his time to go,
Well, enough to line his grave.

Say, mate, have you ever seen the mills
Where the kids at the looms spit blood?
Have you been in the mines when the fire-damp blew?
Have you shipped as a hand with a freighter's crew
Or worked in a levee flood?

Have you rotted wet in a grading-camp,
Or scorched on a desert line?
Or done your night stunt with your lamp,
Watching the timbers drip with damp
And hearing the oil-rig whine?

Have you seen the grinders fade and die,
As the steel-dust cut them down?
Have you heard the tunnel-driller's cry
When the shale caved in? Have you stood by
When his wife came up from town?

Have you had your pay held back for tools
That you never saw or could use?
Have you gone like a fool with the other fools
To the boss's saloon, where the strong-arm rules,
And cashed your time for booze?

Well, those are the games—I've played 'em all—
That a man like me can play.
And this lovely world is a hard old ball;
And so at the last I took a fall
To the right and proper way;

And that is to see all the sights you can
Without the admission price.
That's why I've changed to a traveling man,
With a quilt and a rope and a kind of plan
Of hitting no one place twice.

I do no kicking at God or Fate;
I keep my shoes for the road—and I love it, mate;
Hay-foot, straw-foot, that's my gait!
And I carry no other man's load.

For I'm free! Oh, the lowlands by the sea
To the mountains clear across
On the other side, they belong to me;
A man owns nothing unless he's free,
And I am my own good boss.

I don't mind working to earn my bread,
And I'd just as soon keep straight,
But according to what the preacher said,
I'm a ram—and I've missed the gate;
But I'm jogging ahead, and jogging ahead,
And perhaps I'll find it, mate. 
Lie inside of my ribs, caged
In a blanket of spring. Warm
And numb in a cornucopia
Of love whilst it howls outside.

Please, stop recalling time as
if it is the oxygen you breathe.
We have until the last sheep
verbally dismembers me cold.

I feel I only have a little left.
Yet only a fraction has been
Taken. Hurry, find me, and
allow me to climb out of my brain.

i get lost in the
valleys but You
always bring me
to a clearing

before we shove 
on you bandage
my heels.

Blue sheep move on mountains tall,
so tall in heights galore.
As you look and celebrate
You’ll dance at grassy shore.

If you follow path you’ll find, 
some purple sheep as well.
I believe they are a gift.
I think they are so swell.

If you never saw blue sheep,
now take my advice.
As you move inside your heart,
you won’t have to look twice.

For they will start inside your dreams,
quickly they will appear.
Sharing laughter as they aid,
so you move without care.

And if you see purple ones,
make a wish so fine.
It will come to you with grace.
You are a sacred rhyme.

I open my mouth to speak to a crowd of  unsimulated sheep, I was a king then, I am a king now, but I've never seen a bow, I conquer minds, unravel the individual sign write on it I am not hungry but I would love some common courtesy, seeing pass the facade of happy caring faces, we are all like ogres thick layers of self doubt, piecing together a broken fault, the best release may be inner peace, but our perfect creations become corrupted at the slightest tease, how am I to speak when no one reads, there are so many screens invading the scene, even now there is a glow upon your face, and the sheep are beckoning the insomniac to sleep, the choice is when, the decision cannot be corrected by easy pill supplements, conspiracies, floating in a pool of ignorance, calling out each others name as life lines, together our words may blanket the eyes, forming the disguise that reveals the truth hidden within I

It runs so deep
The rage at sheep
When you let them 
Switch the script
You got flipped
And fleeced
Had your morality
Phased shifted 
While you were asleep
Subliminally
Subjected to group think
And you blame me
Go ahead 
Point your guns
Direct your rage at me
It always seems to be
That the messengers
Gets you the truth
And then gets a bullet
From you
Thousands of sheep, soft-footed, black-nosed sheep--
one by one going up the hill and over the fence--one by
one four-footed pattering up and over--one by one wiggling
their stub tails as they take the short jump and go
over--one by one silently unless for the multitudinous
drumming of their hoofs as they move on and go over--
thousands and thousands of them in the grey haze of
evening just after sundown--one by one slanting in a
long line to pass over the hill--

I am the slow, long-legged Sleepyman and I love you
sheep in Persia, California, Argentine, Australia, or
Spain--you are the thoughts that help me when I, the
Sleepyman, lay my hands on the eyelids of the children
of the world at eight o'clock every night--you thousands
and thousands of sheep in a procession of dusk making
an endless multitudinous drumming on the hills with
your hoofs. 
One sheep is a prized animal, 
That may have spoken words
We cannot distinguish but it can 
Trust with its own form of intellect.
One sheep gifts us with stupid lessons, 
That recur infinitely with patience, 
Spreading the message of truth.
One sheep is now so precious
That we donate death to itself, 
Fixing the wisdom of its entrails.
One sheep is not one lamb
Bearing slight news of torches
That shine young light, 
The sheep are forgotten
When the lambs are born, 
For we are with the children
Of this world, now that you are death.
Death is a solution to the weak and strong, 
Both of them will die forgetting a trance.
The flock is to be kept hidden, 
Like a shepherd good at rearing sheep, 
Goodness is attached to the sleep.

How many sheep are straying
Lost from the Savior's fold!
Upon the lonely mountain, They shiver with the cold:
Within the tangled thickets,
Where poison vines do creep,
And over rocky ledges
Still roam the poor lost sheep.

O come, let us go and find them!
In the paths of death they roam.
At the close of the day 'twill be sweet to say:
"I have brought some lost one home."

O who will go to find them?
Who, for the Savior's sake,
Will search with tireless patience
Through brier and through brake
Unheeding thirst or hunger,
Who still from day to day,
Will seek, as for treasure,
The sheep that go astray?

O come, let us go and find them!
In the paths of death they roam.
At the close of the day 'twill be sweet to say:
"I have brought some lost one home."

Say, will you seek to find them?
From pleasant bow'rs of ease
Will you go forth determined
To find the least of these?
For still the Savior calls them,
And looks across the wold,
And still He holds wide open
The door into His fold.

O come, let us go and find them!
In the paths of death they roam.
At the close of the day 'twill be sweet to say:
"I have brought some lost one home."

How sweet 'twound be at evening
If you and I could say,
"Good Shepherd we've been seeking
The sheep that went astray!
Heartsore and faint with hunger,
We heard them making moan,
And lo! we come at nightfall,
And bear them safely home."

O come, let us go and find them!
In the paths of death they roam.
At the close of the day 'twill be sweet to say:
"I have brought some lost one home." From their folded mates they wander far, 
   Their ways seem harsh and wild; 
They follow the beck of a baleful star, 
   Their paths are dream-beguiled. 

Yet haply they sought but a wider range, 
   Some loftier mountain-slope, 
And little recked of the country strange 
   Beyond the gates of hope. 

And haply a bell with a luring call 
   Summoned their feet to tread 
Midst the cruel rocks, where the deep pitfall 
   And the lurking snare are spread. 

Maybe, in spite of their tameless days 
   Of outcast liberty, 
They're sick at heart for the homely ways 
   Where their gathered brothers be. 

And oft at night, when the plains fall dark 
   And the hills loom large and dim, 
For the Shepherd's voice they mutely hark, 
   And their souls go out to him. 

Meanwhile, "Black sheep! Black sheep!" we cry, 
   Safe in the inner fold; 
And maybe they hear, and wonder why, 
   And marvel, out in the cold. 
   
   THE red deer loves the chaparral, 
The hawk the wind-rocked pine; 
The ouzel haunts the rills that race 
The cañon's steep incline; 
But the wild sheep from the battered rocks, 
Sure foot and fleet of limb, 
Gets up to see the stars go by 
Along the mountain-rim. 

For him the sky-built battlements, 
For him the cliff and scar, 
For him the deep-walled chasms 
Where the roaring rivers are; 
The gentian-flowered meadow-lands, 
The tamarack slope and crest, 
Above the eagle's screaming brood, 
Above the wild wolf's quest. 

When in the riot of the storms 
The snow-flowers blossom fair, 
The cattle get them to the plain, 
The howlers to the lair. 
The shepherd tends his foolish flocks 
Along the mountain's hem; 
But free and far the wild sheep are, 
And God doth shepherd them.
