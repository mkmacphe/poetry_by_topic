Feeling her head pick up her body,
Death before resurrection is hard;
Dread says to herself: Serves me right

A Wooden way
Regardless grown,

Remembered, if outlived,

which I hate more than I hate myself: 
gobsmacked, hubby and...when I realise 
that words no longer count for much at all. 

I do not suffer for my art, I just suffer. 

what curly Shona said that night at Graffiti 
when all the gang were gathered for the show: 
how she reckoned I would be the first to die, 

to hear my best friend tell a stranger girl 

a brilliance all the unchipped faces of design
refuse. The wine collects its starlets
at a lip's fault, sunlight where the nicked
glass angles, and affection where the eye
is least correctable, where arrows of
unquivered light are lodged, where someone
else's eyes have come to be concerned.

For beauty's sake, assault and drive and burn
the devil from the simply perfect sun.
Demand a birthmark on the skin of love,
a tremble in the touch, in come a cry,
and let the silverware of nights be flecked,
the moon pocked to distribute more or less
indwelling alloys of its dim and shine
by nip and tuck, by chance's dance of laws.

The brightness drawn and quartered on a sheet,
the moment cracked upon a bed, will last
as if you soldered them with moon and flux.
And break the bottle of the eye to see
what lights are spun of accident and glass.

I should be happy with my lot: 
Enough for me to be content? 
What other blessing could be sent? 

A quiet house, and homely ways, 
That make each day like other days; 

No beggar brings his misery; 
I have no power, no healing art 
With bruised soul or broken heart. 

I read the poets of the age, 
I study Art, but Art is dead 
To one who clamors to be fed 

O foolish wish! I still should pine 
If any other lot were mine.

Living from pill to pill, from bed to couch,
Pain dissolves like chalk in water,
grit on the bottom of the glass.
Waiting takes forever,
throbs to the soles of my feet, Bella noche . . .
Hives as large as mice hump up under my skin
My right foot is made of elephant hide
and weighs in at roughly one cartload of potatoes.
prednisone buzz in the brain; a motel room
with sixteen foreign workers sleeping in shifts,
playing reggae at three a.m.
2.
Oh I love my white pill
that makes the black fist of pain unclench,
unspasming the nerves. I float,
released to darkness visible,
worlds dissolving.
And the yellow pill, bitter on my tongue,
that wakes me at 2 a.m.
writing out plans in Arabic
to organize an expedition to the Pole.
Drug of hubris searing my eyes,
my scrawl unreadable in daylight: foil my enemies.
Bitter taste of fugue,
my hand shakes: some foreign being in my brain giving orders.
You must You must You will.
Later, the pungent brown liquor
shoots the dark with threads of gold behind my eyes.
One flash as the mind goes out.
3.
I must elude pain
pain in the brain
Fly on a stovetop
This is illusion,
What can be undone
If you kill pain
pain does not feel pain,
My skin will crawl with bugs
Reality is so cruel.
Prednisone oh prednisone
so fast my mind racing, never tasting
rest.
Razzle-dazzle razz
(I saw a werewolf in a white suit, walking
Floppy bow tie, big furry hands.)
Percodan, Percocet, let you go, let you rest.
When the grip lets you go and you float like a note
black oil of opiate. Chatty Cathy, dirty brat,
bed-wetter, nasty pants.
Painkiller, painkiller, I have a new friend,
better than my old friend,
plugging holes in the brain:
Sigmund Freud, Sigmund Freud, Sigmund Freud, Cocaine!
I want a soft landing; let me float.
Once the seizure lifted me and threw me down.
I did not like it. I did not like lying there
on the floor looking up
through air like green water.
4.
And there is one so dark, a ghost,
it passes through the mesh of thought
without tearing a strand, whispering
destinies perceived true, pronouncing
sentences of death.
5.
A cloud, the absence of a noun, no name,
roaring far away in the summer
dark like a train, or a giant fan, or a highway that never stops.
The mind explodes in the dark of space,
unnursed by atmospheres,
as air raid sirens scream for blood
and I am only nerves, strung on constellations,
meridians and vectors quivering. A red and yellow
capsule invades the chemistry of thought; cathode rays blast
from the television screen and signals pass deep into space
will not remember this night.

I wanted to give you something for your pain.
But not the drug du jour
in a department store or dark alleyway.
I wanted to give you something for your pain
seemed too plain (too plain and too gross).
to you or me, or even Nature: a creature
more fabulous, more imaginary
or pixel-loaded screen. Some exotic anodyne
an alchemist or astrophysicist
would be envious of: a chemical reaction,
an astral refraction, an out-of-body,
out-of-mind, one-of-a-kind
transport from your pain, that would last
longer than a day, go deeper than the past.
I would have founded a whole new religion
if I thought that would suffice.
I wanted to give you something
and was hard to maintain and had a knack
for disappointing. I wanted to give you
and relentless tendency to wane
might have only exacerbated your pain).
If I could have given you something
you could depend on, could always trust
without a second thought, I would have.
A splendid view, perhaps, or a strain
of music. A favorite dish. A familiar tree.
A visit from a genie who, in lieu of granting you
a wish, would tend subtly to your every need,
and never once tire, never complain.
But when all was said and done
(or hardly said, not nearly done)
or were you so overcome your pain was all
that mattered? It seemed to me we were a kind
of kin: willing the mind its bold suspensions,
but the heart, once shattered, never quite matching
its old dimensions. And yet you persevered
in spite of pain, you knew to hold hope
as lightly as you held my hand (a phantom grasp,
a clasp that seemed to come from the other side).
And your genial smile made it plain: you were pleased
by my wish to please. And then you died.

I

I can hear little clicks inside my dream.
Night drips its silver tap
down the back.
At 4 A.M. I wake. Thinking

of the man who
left in September.
His name was Law.

My face in the bathroom mirror
has white streaks down it.
I rinse the face and return to bed.
Tomorrow I am going to visit my mother.

SHE

She lives on a moor in the north.
She lives alone.
Spring opens like a blade there.

some for my mother, some for me
This is my favourite author.

Also my main fear, which I mean to confront.
Whenever I visit my mother

my lonely life around me like a moor,
my ungainly body stumping over the mud flats with a look of transformation
that dies when I come in the kitchen door.
What meat is it, Emily, we need?

THREE

Three silent women at the kitchen table.
there is the moor, paralyzed with ice.
It extends as far as the eye can see

over flat miles to a solid unlit white sky.
Mother and I are chewing lettuce carefully.
The kitchen wall clock emits a ragged low buzz that jumps

once a minute over the twelve.
I have Emily p. 216 propped open on the sugarbowl
but am covertly watching my mother.

A thousand questions hit my eyes from the inside.
My mother is studying her lettuce.
I turn to p. 217.

who was hanging a litter of puppies

It is as if we have all been lowered into an atmosphere of glass.
Now and then a remark trails through the glass.
Taxes on the back lot. Not a good melon,

too early for melons.
Hairdresser in town found God, closes shop every Tuesday.
Mice in the teatowel drawer again.
Little pellets. Chew off

the corners of the napkins, if they knew
what paper napkins cost nowadays.
Rain tonight.

Rain tomorrow.
Anderson died no not Shirley

the opera singer. Negress.
Cancer.

Out the window I can see dead leaves ticking over the flatland
and dregs of snow scarred by pine filth.
At the middle of the moor

where the ground goes down into a depression,
the ice has begun to unclench.
Black open water comes

curdling up like anger. My mother speaks suddenly.

My mother has a way of summing things up.
She never liked Law much
but she liked the idea of me having a man and getting on with life.

was all she said after she met him.
Give and take were just words to me

at the time. I had not been in love before.
It was like a wheel rolling downhill.
But early this morning while mother slept

and I was downstairs reading the part in Wuthering Heights
where Heathcliff clings at the lattice in the storm sobbing

I fell on my knees on the rug and sobbed too.
She knows how to hang puppies,
that Emily.

Dr. Haw says grief is a long process.
She frowns. What does it accomplish

all that raking up the past?
I prevail! I look her in the eye.
She grins. Yes you do.

Unsociable even at home

and unable to meet the eyes of strangers when she ventured out,
Emily made her awkward way
across days and years whose bareness appalls her biographers.

This sad stunted life, says one.
Uninteresting, unremarkable, wracked by disappointment
and despair, says another.

suggests a third. Meanwhile
Emily continued to brush into the carpet the question,

Why cast the world away.
For someone hooked up to Thou,
the world may have seemed a kind of half-finished sentence.

But in between the neighbour who recalls her
coming in from a walk on the moors

and the sister who tells us
Emily never made a friend in her life,
is a space where the little raw soul

slips through.
It goes skimming the deep keel like a storm petrel,
out of sight.

The little raw soul was caught by no one.
or a fear of death. She worked

in total six months of her life (at a school in Halifax)
and died on the sofa at home at 2 P.M. on a winter afternoon
in her thirty-first year. She spent

most of the hours of her life brushing the carpet,

Imagine a big room of women doing anything,
playing cards, having a meeting, the rattle
of paper or coffee cups or chairs pushed back,
the loud and quiet murmur of their voices,
women leaning their heads together. If we
leaned in at the door and I said, Those women
at me for pointing out the obvious fact.

Say we walked around to 8th or 11th Street
to drop in on a roomful of women, smiling, intense,
playing pool, the green baize like moss. One
Others dance by twos under twirling silver moons
that rain light down in glittering drops.
If I said in your ear, through metallic guitars,
would you? Not really, not even if you had come

what we say. In the clanging silence, pain falls
on our hearts, year in and out, like water cutting
a groove in stone, seeking a channel, a way out,
pain running like water through the glittering room.

I often think of a poem as a door that opens
into a room where I want to go. But to go in

here is to enter where my own suffering exists
as an almost unheard low note in the music,
amplified, almost unbearable, by the presence
of us all, reverberant pain, circular, endless,

which we speak of hardly at all, unless a woman
in the dim privacy tells me a story of her child
lost, now or twenty years ago, her words sliding
like a snapshot out of her billfold, faded outline
glanced at and away from, the story elliptic, oblique
to avoid the dangers of grief. The flashes of story
brilliant and grim as strobe lights in the dark,
the dance shown as grimace, head thrown back in pain.

Her skinny brown arms folded against her flat breasts,
And who would call her a mother?
Or tall pale Connie,
rainbow skirts twirling, her sailing-away plans, islands,
women plaiting straw with shells: Who would have known
until the night, head down on my shoulder, she cried out
for her children shoved behind the father, shadows
as she waited for them in the shriveled yard?

All the women caught in flaring light, glimpsed
in mystery: The red-lipped, red-fingertipped woman
who dances by, sparkling like fire, is she here on the sly,
The butch in black denim, elegant as ashes, her son
The quiet woman drinking gin, thinking of being sixteen,
the baby wrinkled as wet clothes, seen once, never again.

A few words, some gesture of our hands, some bit of story
cryptic as the mark gleaming on our hands, the ink
tattoo, the sign that admits us to this room, iridescent
in certain kinds of light, then vanishing, invisible.

played through four times with its sad lyric,
only half-heard in the noisy room, then done with,
I could write the poem I imagined: All the women
here see their lost children come into the dim room,
the lights brighten, we are in the happy ending,
no more hiding, we are ourselves and they are here
with us, a reconciliation, a commotion of voices.

Wanda. I have my own: the hammering at authority,
the years of driving round and round for a glimpse,
for anything, and finally the child, big, awkward,
comes with you, to walk somewhere arm in arm.

But things have been done to us that can never be
undone. The woman in the corner smiling at friends,
the one with black hair glinting white, remembers
The brown-eyed baby who flirted before she talked,
taken and sent away twenty years ago, no recourse.
If she stood in the door, the woman would not know her,
and the child would have no memory of the woman,
not of lying on her knees nor at her breast, leaving
a hidden mark, pain grooved and etched on the heart.

keep forgetting. Her story drifts away like smoke,
like vague words in a song, a paper scrap in the water.
When they talk about mothers, they never think of her.

No easy ending to this pain. At midnight we go home
to silent houses, or perhaps to clamorous rooms full
of those who are now our family. Perhaps we sit alone,
heavy with the past, and there are tears running bitter
and steady as rain in the night. Mostly we just go on.

He did not wear his scarlet coat,
    For blood and wine are red,
And blood and wine were on his hands
    When they found him with the dead,
The poor dead woman whom he loved,
    And murdered in her bed.

He walked amongst the Trial Men
    In a suit of shabby gray;
A cricket cap was on his head,
    And his step seemed light and gay;
But I never saw a man who looked
    So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
    With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
    Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every drifting cloud that went
    With sails of silver by.

I walked, with other souls in pain,
    Within another ring,
And was wondering if the man had done
    A great or little thing,
When a voice behind me whispered low,
"That fellow's got to swing." 

Dear Christ! the very prison walls
    Suddenly seemed to reel,
And the sky above my head became
    Like a casque of scorching steel;
And, though I was a soul in pain,
    My pain I could not feel.

I only knew what hunted thought
    Quickened his step, and why
He looked upon the garish day
    With such a wistful eye;
The man had killed the thing he loved,
    And so he had to die.

Yet each man kills the thing he loves,
    By each let this be heard,
Some do it with a bitter look,
    Some with a flattering word,
The coward does it with a kiss,
    The brave man with a sword!

Some kill their love when they are young,
    And some when they are old;
Some strangle with the hands of Lust,
    Some with the hands of Gold:
The kindest use a knife, because
    The dead so soon grow cold.

Some love too little, some too long,
    Some sell, and others buy;
Some do the deed with many tears,
    And some without a sigh:
For each man kills the thing he loves,
    Yet each man does not die.

He does not die a death of shame
    On a day of dark disgrace,
Nor have a noose about his neck,
    Nor a cloth upon his face,
Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
    Into an empty space.

He does not sit with silent men
    Who watch him night and day;
Who watch him when he tries to weep,
    And when he tries to pray;
Who watch him lest himself should rob
    The prison of its prey.

He does not wake at dawn to see
    Dread figures throng his room,
The shivering Chaplain robed in white,
    The Sheriff stern with gloom,
And the Governor all in shiny black,
    With the yellow face of Doom.

He does not rise in piteous haste
    To put on convict-clothes,
While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes
    Each new and nerve-twitched pose,
Fingering a watch whose little ticks
    Are like horrible hammer-blows.

He does not know that sickening thirst
    That sands one's throat, before
The hangman with his gardener's gloves
    Slips through the padded door,
And binds one with three leathern thongs,
That the throat may thirst no more.

He does not bend his head to hear
    The Burial Office read,
Nor while the terror of his soul
    Tells him he is not dead,
Cross his own coffin, as he moves
    Into the hideous shed.

He does not stare upon the air
    Through a little roof of glass:
He does not pray with lips of clay
    For his agony to pass;
Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
    The kiss of Caiaphas.

Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard,
    In the suit of shabby gray:
His cricket cap was on his head,
    And his step seemed light and gay,
But I never saw a man who looked
    So wistfully at the day.

I never saw a man who looked
    With such a wistful eye
Upon that little tent of blue
    Which prisoners call the sky,
And at every wandering cloud that trailed
    Its ravelled fleeces by.

He did not wring his hands, as do
    Those witless men who dare
To try to rear the changeling Hope
    In the cave of black Despair:
He only looked upon the sun,
    And drank the morning air.

He did not wring his hands nor weep,
    Nor did he peek or pine,
But he drank the air as though it held
    Some healthful anodyne;
With open mouth he drank the sun
    As though it had been wine!

And I and all the souls in pain,
    Who tramped the other ring,
Forgot if we ourselves had done
    A great or little thing,
And watched with gaze of dull amaze
    The man who had to swing.

For strange it was to see him pass
    With a step so light and gay,
And strange it was to see him look
    So wistfully at the day,
And strange it was to think that he
    Had such a debt to pay.

For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
    That in the spring-time shoot:
But grim to see is the gallows-tree,
    With its alder-bitten root,
And, green or dry, a man must die
    Before it bears its fruit!

The loftiest place is that seat of grace
    For which all worldlings try:
But who would stand in hempen band
    Upon a scaffold high,
And through a murderer's collar take
    His last look at the sky?

It is sweet to dance to violins
    When Love and Life are fair:
To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes
    Is delicate and rare:
But it is not sweet with nimble feet
    To dance upon the air!

So with curious eyes and sick surmise
    We watched him day by day,
And wondered if each one of us
    Would end the self-same way,
For none can tell to what red Hell
    His sightless soul may stray.

At last the dead man walked no more
    Amongst the Trial Men,
And I knew that he was standing up
    In the black dock's dreadful pen,
And that never would I see his face
    In God's sweet world again.

Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
    We had crossed each other's way:
But we made no sign, we said no word,
    We had no word to say;
For we did not meet in the holy night,
    But in the shameful day.

Eva's hours have nearer ends.
She heats the little disk the cat sleeps on;
chips, until her hands are gone,
the glaze off all the feeders for the birds;
then writes two friends
to thank them for the birthday chocolates they've sent.
The word alone makes her stomach burn.
Which is mostly what age is, she's learned,
the senses sharpening backwards,
keen to what they can't perceive,
when to be wise means mostly not to wish
for what you love,
for what you love is pain:
spices or coffee, gin
bringing the evening light into your veins,
good chocolates the grandkids ravish
like a horde of crows.
You stuff your bellies with tomorrow's ache,
she can almost hear him bellow,
nipping and pinching to make them squeal.
Hot water with honey, one coddled egg, dry saltines:
Oh, what difference does it make?
She picks up the chocolates, breaks
the seal.
 

He draws the blinds on a wall of glass,
winces at the glare,
drags his chair
into the bright crevasse
between his bed and bookshelf,
takes a deep breath of air,
and buries himself
in one of the early wordy furies
of William Gladstone,
never a man for minor keys.
Creak and tick of the burdened limbs.
A creak and tick inside of him
as he crosses his legs and then uncrosses them,
shifts his weight to ease
the stiffness in one side,
turns a page like a summit he has climbed,
and breathes...
in Gladstone's life, and of his own
enough to keep an army of bibliographers occupied;
a whole age and empire crammed into one man:
spellbinding crowds until he couldn't stand,
felling his million trees,
filling six decades' worth of diaries
because a life is owed as well as owned, time
a gift of which a good man gives account;
who would mount,
night after night, a moral, high-rhetorical siege
upon some poor Haymarket tart
in whom ruin
and beauty were one word,
then go home and whip himself for a sin
that, all the evidence suggests, never occurred
but in his heart.
 

And has just one,
pleasure spreading through her blood like a single drop
of ink.
She scours the stove and countertop,
bleaches coffee stains off the sink,
cleans leaf by leaf
the emerald ripple and the paradise palm,
both mostly dormant now,
reaches high for the philodendron, huge since trained to climb,
and pauses,
remembering the calm
a beauty, men said, though it hardly seemed
a part of her, looking out of her own face
like someone on a train;
and remembering, too,
the child-high hedgerows
alone the lane
behind their house on Paddox Close,
the slice of sky above
growing wider as she grew,
the little park with its central statue
(who was it of?),
which, last time she'd seen,
weather had worried
to a Swedish ivy sort of green.
 

even the names of those women are there
amid the parliamentary proceedings,
bulldog scholarship, affairs
of state.
He lifts his hand like a weight
to check his watch, little trembles traveling through his bones
into the air
as through plucked strings
a sound.
Two hours until the final round
at Palm Springs,
with its hairpin fairways, lacquered greens,
and that great eighteenth in homage
to Bobby Jones.
retired at twenty-eight
with nothing left to win,
at forty storming Normandy with men
half his age.
without a trace of self-pity, regret, rage:
We all have to play the ball as it lies.
How much of a man's revealed in how he dies...
Poor Owen, barely sixty, Dean of the College,
a decent book on Kant behind him:
two days of chest pain
slivering into a lifetime's knowledge
and all the old beliefs
come flooding back,
silly relics and rituals, griefs
you're born into, some guilt you can't even name.
"Ischemia," that's exactly right: blood lack.
 

Sweet pickles and white bread,
salted ham,
a soybean spread
that is his one concession to his heart,
two butter cookies, plum jam:
she clicks
across the polished floor
through motes that rise
and float like molecules of light,
pausing outside his door,
hearing the Mahler chorus to which he always cries,
plays to cry, she suspects,
as if even sadness could be planned.
She takes the knob in her hand,
sees, inside its shine,
white tablecloths, crystal cut fine
as jewels,
and, and... and a man
with American shoulders and vowels,
that face
so open it wasn't, like the ocean,
and that tidal way he had of filling any space
that wasn't taken,
the table where she sat with friends,
afternoons and weekends,
classrooms, boardrooms, lecture halls,
the very bodies of their children,
in whose broad limbs he seems to sprawl.
Was that what she had fallen for,
talk of golf, and Oxford, and roast beef
in that gray decade after the war,
that it seemed so safe
a fall?
 

and that woman's whole soul
is in her throat...
A home can have but one composer.
Wasn't that the quote?
That long ironclad letter Mahler wrote
to Alma, the most exquisite
woman in Vienna, who packed
away that cold contract,
her party dresses, and her own precocious technique,
and settled, if you could call it that,
into the role
I am inside someone
who hates me. I look
out from his eyes. Smell
what fouled tunes come in
to his breath. Love his
wretched women.

Slits in the metal, for sun. Where
my eyes sit turning, at the cool air
the glance of light, or hard flesh
rubbed against me, a woman, a man,
without shadow, or voice, or meaning.

This is the enclosure (flesh,
where innocence is a weapon. An
abstraction. Touch. (Not mine.
Or yours, if you are the soul I had
and abandoned when I was blind and had
my enemies carry me as a dead man
(if he is beautiful, or pitied.

It can be pain. (As now, as all his
flesh hurts me.) It can be that. Or
pain. As when she ran from me into
that forest.
silver spiraled whirled against the
sun, higher than even old men thought
God would be. Or pain. And the other. The
yes. (Inside his books, his fingers. They
are withered yellow flowers and were never
beautiful.) The yes. You will, lost soul, say
slow river. A white sun in its wet sentences.

Or, the cold men in their gale. Ecstasy. Flesh
or soul. The yes. (Their robes blown. Their bowls
empty. They chant at my heels, not at yours.) Flesh
or soul, as corrupt. Where the answer moves too quickly.
Where the God is a self, after all.)

Cold air blown through narrow blind eyes. Flesh,
white hot metal. Glows as the day with its sun.
It is a human love, I live inside. A bony skeleton
you recognize as words or simple feeling.

But it has no feeling. As the metal, is hot, it is not,
given to love.

It burns the thing
inside it. And that thing
screams.

And those who read what once he wrote
Feel clearly, in the pain they read,
Neither of the pains he felt,
Only a pain they cannot sense.

And thus, around its jolting track
There runs, to keep our reason busy,
The circling clockwork train of ours
That men agree to call a heart.

To those who kiss in fear that they shall never kiss again

To those that love with fear that they shall never love again

To such I dedicate this rhyme and what it may contain.

None of us will ever take the transiberian train

Which makes a very satisfactory refrain

Especially as I can repeat it over and over again

Which is the main use of the refrain.

I with no middle flight intend the truth to speak out plain
Of honour truth and love gone by that has come back again
The fact is one grows weary of the love that comes again.
I may not know much about gods but I know that
Eros is a strong purple god.
And that there is a point where incest becomes
We have been mutually avoiding each other
For years and will continue to do so.
Something. The word you want is Dante.
He said he loved Beatrice. Whatever he did
Beatrice Portinari whom history gives.
He knew her and the point about all these
Florentines is that they all were
Killing each other or dying of rapid
Consumption. Beatrice died; Rossetti painted her
Cutting Dante in the street. Botticelli
Painted the rest: Simonetta Vespucci
Died of a rapid consumption (age 23)
Giuliano dei Medici murdered by the altar rail (age 19)
Guido Cavalcanti died in exile (age 35)
Dante dei Aligeri died in exile (age 90)
Lorenzo dei Medici who lives for ever
Since he stayed there and commissioned
The paintings, and poems and statues
And if he also commissioned the deaths
Very magnificent when his brother
Was murdered in sanctuary.
Do you realise whoever did that
Would be excommunicated if, that is, if
His best friend.
I have lived long enough having seen one thing;
That term has an end.
It was getting dark on the platform of nowhere
When I who was anxious and sad came to you
Out of the rain. Out of the sound of the cold
Wind that blows time before and time after
Even Provence knows.
And as for this line I stole it from T.S. Eliot
And Ezra Pound and A.C. Swinburne. All very good
Poets to steal from since they are all three dead.
The love that is must always just contain
The glory of the love that was whatever be the pain.
We played at mates and mating and stopped up the drain.
Hear me. O Mister Poster I know
You have burnt me too brown you must boil me again
You simply have no notion how delightful it will
Be when they pick us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea.
It is the lark, my love, and not the nightingale.
None of us will ever take the trans-siberian train.
She wanted to and was collecting people who did
It is the lark, my love, and not the nightingale.
But people say they sound very similar.
And what the devil were Romeo and Juliet
About wasting their last moments
Listening to birds. Hah.
I like kicking up larks or
Larking up kicks. So do most poets
Including J.H. Prynne, the memorable poet
Who is happy to say that the U.L.
Has got his middle name wrong.
He claims it stands for Hah
But there is a limit. I know it all.
Riddle me riddle randy ree
Round and round in the snotgreen sea
When they pick us up and throw us
With the Joyces out to sea.
We all would have liked to have been there.
The infernal Odyssos. He it was whose bile
Stirred up by envy and revenge destroyed
The mother of womankind. And Swinburne
I just get kicked.
Except that if I don't I tend to sound
Like Richard the Second. And who wants that.
I suppose I must sound like Richard the First.
What did he do?
Nothing I take it
I get a kick out of larking up nightingales.
Safe from Sicily by the thirtieth April
They will send a posse.
March is the cruellest station
Taking on bullying men
And were you really afraid they would rape you?
No. I thought there would be grave difficulties.
Not just that I was actively opposed
And so was every other man, woman and child
On that there train.
I was afraid they would kill me.
So simple as to think your name
Is Elizabeth Brown. Well. All right
My name is Veronica Forrest-Thomson.
Agamemnon was King of the Achaians at the time,
Priam, of the Trojans, Theseus, of the Athenians.
And like all Good Kings, they are dead.
In my day it was the done thing to side
With the Trojans for no better reason
Than that they lost. But me I back
Winners every time.
Mary Shelley may go to hell
As she thought she was going to anyway
And take Frankinsense with her.
I want her husband, alive and well.
Who, of course, also got killed.
Hardly surprising if he made a habit
Of reading Aiscylos while sailing.
Got cremated like a pagan king.
Not Agamemnon who, as I said, was king at the time
And lost, murderer of his daughter
Killed by his wife and (other) daughter.
Killed by his death killing his life.
Stabbed in the back in his bath.
I think of it every time I have a bath.
Though I have no sympathy at all
For that daughter and son.
I think it is unfair that Helen
Had everything, immortal beauty,
Lovers, cities destroyed and battles
Fought about her. And she just came home
And calmly went around being Menelaus' wife
While her twin sister, Clytemnestra
Was murdered by her son and daughter.
And the Athenians acquitted them.
They would do, a nation of sophists.
Always betraying their allies and torturing
Women and children and enslaving people.
They even killed Socrates, their one good man,
Then Plato tried to be a philosopher king.
And got enslaved for his pains.
I wish they had kept him enslaved.
He escaped, of course, and wrote books
About how he would do it better
If he was in charge. All poets do that.
They are just as incompetent as the rest
If they try to organise things.
As witness my own efforts in that direction
Or those of my avatar, Agamemnon,
Who, as I say came home and was killed in his bath
Killing his wife and his daughter.
Read it in the Iliad, read it in the Odyssey,
Do not read it in Freud who is always wrong
But first and last read me, the beloved
Who was killed in the general slaughter.
But rise again like John Donne
(read him too) I, Helen, I Iseult, I Guenevere,
I Clytemnestra and many more to come.
I did it, I myself, killing the King my father
Killing the King my mother, joining the King my brother.
It is the kick, my love, and not the nightingale
I like larking up kicks myself
But not kicking.
They that have power to hurt and do so
Should not be blamed by Shakespeare or anyone else
For hurting though such is the race of poets
That they will blame them anyway.
However it is a pretty productive process
Especially if one may be plumber as well as poet
And thus unstop the drain as well as writing
Several other books and poems including
1974 and All That (seriously though)
I, Veronica did it, truth-finding, truth-seeking
Muck-raking, bringing victory.
It was a horse, of course, in which the warriors hid
Pretending to bring peace
Like a lot of fools, hearing the voice of the goddess
In an alien city, I speak your tongue in my own city:
Advised, of course, by Odyssos, solicitor, betrayer.
And when they had killed all the men, raped all the women etc.
Agamemnon came home and, as I said, was stabbed by his wife
In his bath. Anyway it is the lark, my love,
And not the nightingale. I follow the sacred footsteps of
Hippolyta, the blest, the best
That has been said or spoken well in any tongue
I am not Prince Thomas Aquinas F.H. Eliot
I am not an attendant lord either.
I am the king who lives.
Spring surprised us, running through the market square
And went on in sunlight into the University Library
And ate yogurt and talked for an hour.
You, You, grab the reins.
Drink as much as you can and love as much as you can
And work as much as you can
The motto of this poem heed
And do you it employ:
The possibles of joy.

The business of the bland sun
Has no affair with me
In my congested cosmos of agony
From which there is no escape
On infinitely prolonged nerve-vibrations
Or in contraction
To the pinpoint nucleus of being

It is without
The sensitized area
Of intension

I am the false quantity
In the harmony of physiological potentiality
To which
Gaining self-control
I should be consonant
In time

Pain is no stronger than the resisting force
Pain calls up in me
The struggle is equal

The open window is full of a voice
A fashionable portrait painter
Sings
At the back of the thoughts to which I permit crystallization
Why?
Leaves woman her superior Inferiority.
He is running upstairs

I am climbing a distorted mountain of agony
Incidentally with the exhaustion of control
I reach the summit
And gradually subside into anticipation of

Repose
Which never comes.
For another mountain is growing up
I must traverse
Traversing myself

Something in the delirium of night hours
Confuses while intensifying sensibility
Blurring spatial contours
So aiding elusion of the circumscribed
That the gurgling of a crucified wild beast
Comes from so far away
And the foam on the stretched muscles of a mouth
Is no part of myself
There is a climax in sensibility
When pain surpassing itself
Becomes exotic
Uniting the opposing and resisting forces
In lascivious revelation

Relaxation
Negation of myself as a unit
I should have been emptied of life
Giving life

Through the subliminal deposits of evolutionary processes

Have I not
Somewhere
Scrutinized
A dead white feathered moth
Laying eggs?
A moment
Being realization
Can
Vitalized by cosmic initiation
Furnish an adequate apology
For the objective
Agglomeration of activities
Of a life
LIFE
A leap with nature
Into the essence
Of unpredicted Maternity
Against my thigh
Tough of infinitesimal motion
Scarcely perceptible
Undulation
Stir of incipient life
Precipitating into me

The contents of the universe
Mother I am
Identical
With infinite Maternity
Of cosmic reproductivity

Rises from the subconscious
Impression of a cat
With blind kittens
Among her legs
Same undulating life-stir
I am that cat

Rises from the sub-conscious
Impression of small animal carcass
Covered with blue bottles
And through the insects
Waves that same undulation of living
Death
Life
I am knowing
All about

The next morning
Each woman-of-the-people
Tiptoeing the red pile of the carpet
Doing hushed service
Each woman-of-the-people
Wearing a halo
A ludicrous little halo
Of which she is sublimely unaware

I once heard in a church

into the innermost space

Ah! What avails the classic bent  
Against the undoctored incident  

And what is Art whereto we press  
When Nature in her nakedness 

It is not learning, grace nor gear, 
But bitter pinch of pain and fear 

The longest arm, the sharpest tooth,  

Till, bruised and bitten to the bone 
He learned to deal the far-off stone, 

So tooth and nail were obsolete  
Till, bored by uniform defeat,  

Then stone and javelin proved as vain  
Till, spurred anew by fear and pain,  

Then was there safety for the rich  
Till someone mixed a powder which 

Helmet and armour disappeared 
And, when the smoke of battle cleared, 

And when ten million such were slain  
Man, schooled in bulk by fear and pain,  

And, at the very hour designed 
His tooth-stone-arrow-gun-shy mind  

All Power, each Tyrant, every Mob 
Ends by destroying its own job 

And Man, whose mere necessities 
Trembles meanwhile at their decrees, 

O all fair lovers about the world, 
My thoughts are as dead things, wrecked and whirled 
Is there a sound? There is a forest.
What is the world? The word is wilderness.
What is the answer? The answer is the world.
What is the beginning? A beginning is happiness.
What is the end? No one lives there now.
What is a beginning? The beginning is light.
What makes happiness? Nothing.
What makes an ending? What does not.
What is her skin?  Her skin is composed of strange clothing and clouds of butterflies,
What makes a question? Birds in the evening.
When do birds die? When it is complete.
What makes a world? The leaves shimmer in the wind, they
What is music? A man lives there with his sister, they count the buses passing
Who is happy? Nothing is necessary, everything that is is.
When does it end? A green delight the wounded mind endears
What is the beginning? The completion.
How does it complicate? In that it dazzles.
When does it matter? Blue loaves of dusk.
Who listens? There will be prizes.
What is a child? Blue lives of dusk.
Where does dust come from? From tropical skies.
What does a child do? Listens with his body, with her body.
When does it end? Listens with the hands.
Does it end? The hands which are small and wide.
Where do children come from? White pebbles.
Who suffers? No one returns from there.
Who suffers? There was once a small forest with a path of white pebbles
Is there a sound? There is a forest.
Who listens? Another theory of the origin of the universe holds that
What matters? There is a forest.
What does the child think? The child.
What does the child think? Happiness.
What child? A word is a small part of itself, it is round at times, and it satisfies
Does it answer? It does not.
What is pain? A man turns and locks his door with exactly the same small
Who suffers? Oh, it is true, there are causes of cruelty, it is that kind of world.
What is geometry? It is how we know, and what.
What is the purpose of memory? Blue lines of dust.
Does the child suffer? The child is suffering.
Is the child cruel? The child crushes the world at will, the child destroys
What is to crush?

At home, in my flannel gown, like a bear to its floe,
I clambered to bed; up the globe's impossible sides
My furs and my dogs, I stood at the northern pole.

There in the childish night my companions lay frozen,
The stiff furs knocked at my starveling throat,
And I gave my great sigh: the flakes came huddling,
Were they really my end? In the darkness I turned to my rest.

Of the unbroken ice. I stand here,
The dogs bark, my beard is black, and I stare
At the North Pole . . .

Turn as I please, my step is to the south.
Of cold and wretchedness: all lines, all winds
End in this whirlpool I at last discover.

And it is meaningless. In the child's bed
After the night's voyage, in that warm world
Where people work and suffer for the end

I reached my North and it had meaning.
Here at the actual pole of my existence,
Where all that I have done is meaningless,

Where, living or dying, I am still alone;
Here where North, the night, the berg of death
Crowd me out of the ignorant darkness,
I see at last that all the knowledge
Is worthless as ignorance: nothing comes from nothing,
And we call it wisdom. It is pain.

And the dead man was sick with sorrow
and his flesh wasted away
and his pale lips ate back from his mouth
and his teeth were bared in a base grin.

And the man tore from his face the grin
and there underneath it rose a chortling.

Life, dreams are of flesh. Now

Without tears and sorrow and without waving a hanky
bones took their leave of the dead man, from the one body
and left, each bone on its solitary journey.
lose touch with the pain that gave them birth,
and set sail in the air, playful gusts of sound,
so the bones quit the body of the dead man
to roll an independent roll through the ground.

And the dead man continually shrank, and continually shriveled,
bit by bit of him was lost.
The leg detached from the body and went its way
and became a separate entity.
The hands left one another and became estranged,
what are you to me, we were sisters,
two gray spinsters, hard bitten,
falling apart is something we can manage to do alone.

Indeed, the mesh of bone is tough, you will not melt it
with longings and memories; another world, hard and strange
hides beneath our flesh; bone does not love
does not remember, not women 
and not the light of the sun, with a rubbing sound
like the sound of porcelain scratching,
it crumbles and with the knock of breaking bones
the living form recedes and is forgotten.

Goodbye legs, goodbye hands, goodbye hip sockets and spare ribs,
goodbye spine and collar bone, goodbye all of you
we knew together a kind of rickety ensemble good for taking pains
that bore on it with a sigh a sackful of hanks of meat
for Christmas; Christmas is past, the meat consumed
fall in autumn, so our body loses its leaves.

And of the dead man just a little ball of skull is left,
and in it four holes packed and bunged with earth
and since the flesh of lips is all eaten and his teeth bared to the end,
and from between bared jaws, as from a broken urn, a last grin blossoms
for is it not a horrified grin, in the skull of death.

that all his forefathers grinned at him (and he joined in
watching the crowd of the dead, and waits expectantly
and they all lay, a field strewn with skulls,
each man a skull deaf and dumb
fastened into the earth and gazing up into the night sky.

winking at the magnificence of the universe and its secret,
winking at the horrors of death and its terrors.

And firmament looks at firmament, as in a funhouse mirror.
And a man all bent, that goes home alone at night,
seeking a fitting mirror to the burden of his life,
and it has no secret, only a piercing pain
and it has no riddle, only a laughable solution,
and there is no dome of blue, only a peel of mockery
where score upon score of horrified grins
shine gleaming from the lower firmament,

Indeed, it seems shame has no end,
as if death put paid to everything
and only left the insult that wriggles.
And as it grows darker, and there was a dark there
inside of darkness, and as the dead man dies further
and gets lesser, fainter, and crumbles
so the shame magnifies.

And as one who shuts his eyes and squints in the darkness with great effort
suddenly sees colorful stains of light,
so, in the darkness of his adopted death, the dead man sees
the piercing shards of laughter, its cutting leaps,
so hurtful, that there is nothing like it in the embraces of joy
and all the wreath of these colors was not created
except to decorate the pain of our shame.

And at the end of many years, when even the skull is fallen away
and become flakes of dust, the wind
with a whistle of contempt will cast them out
to every part, and still will be borne with them the sound 
of the cry of the dead man,
a moan so great as to never pass:
Hey, you up there, I was here too!

Home goes the tired ass, 
the lights go out slow,
whoever cried out in his sleep 
in his cradle of earth sank, mute.

With his ass and cart Messiah crawls

Why did my parents send me to the schools
That I with knowledge might enrich my mind?
Since the desire to know first made men fools,
And did corrupt the root of all mankind.
For when God's hand had written in the hearts
Of the first parents all the rules of good,
So that their skill infused did pass all arts
That ever were, before or since the flood,
And when their reason's eye was sharp and clear,
And, as an eagle can behold the sun,
Could have approached th'eternal light as near
As the intellectual angels could have done,
Even then to them the spirit of lies suggests
That they were blind, because they saw not ill,
And breathes into their incorrupted breasts
A curious wish, which did corrupt their will.
For that same ill they straight desired to know;
Which ill, being nought but a defect of good,
And all God's works the devil could not show
While man their lord in his perfection stood.
So that themselves were first to do the ill,
Ere they thereof the knowledge could attain;
Like him that knew not poison's power to kill,
Until, by tasting it, himself was slain.
Even so by tasting of that fruit forbid,
Where they sought knowledge, they did error find;
Ill they desired to know, and ill they did,
And to give passion eyes, made reason blind.
For then their minds did first in passion see
Those wretched shapes of misery and woe,
Of nakedness, of shame, of poverty,
Which then their own experience made them know.
But then grew reason dark, that she no more
Could the fair forms of good and truth discern;
Bats they became, that eagles were before,
And this they got by their desire to learn.
But we, their wretched offspring, what do we?
Do not we still taste of the fruit forbid,
Whiles with fond fruitless curiosity
In books profane we seek for knowledge hid?
What is this knowledge but the sky-stolen fire
For which the thief still chained in ice doth sit,
And which the poor rude satyr did admire,
And needs would kiss, but burnt his lips with it.
What is it but the cloud of empty rain,
Which when Jove's guest embraced, he monsters got?
Or the false pails which oft being filled with pain,
Received the water, but retained it not?
Shortly, what is it but the fiery coach
Which the youth sought, and sought his death withal?
Or the boy's wings, which when he did approach
The sun's hot beams, did melt and let him fall?
And yet, alas, when all our lamps are burned,
Our bodies waste, and our spirits spent,
When we have all the learned volumes turned,
Which yield men's wits both help and ornament,
What can we know, or what can we discern,
When error chokes the windows of the mind,
The diverse forms of things, how can we learn,
That have been ever from our birthday blind?
When reason's lamp, which like the sun in sky,
Throughout man's little world her beams did spread,
Is now become a sparkle which doth lie
Under the ashes, half extinct and dead;
How can we hope that through the eye and ear
This dying sparkle, in this cloudy place,
Can recollect these beams of knowledge clear,
Which were infused in the first minds by grace?
So might the heir whose father hath in play
Wasted a thousand pound of ancient rent,
By painful earning of a groat a day
Hope to restore the patrimony spent.
The wits that dived most deep and soared most high,
Seeking man's powers, have found his weakness such;
Skill comes so slow and life so fast doth fly,
We learn so little and forget so much.
For this the wisest of all mortal men
Said, He knew nought but that he nought did know;
And the great mocking master mocked not then,
When he said, Truth was buried deep below.
For how may we to others' things attain,
When none of us his own soul understands?
For which the devil mocks our curious brain,
When, Know thyself, his oracle commands.
For why should we the busy soul believe,
When boldly she concludes of that and this;
When of herself she can no judgment give,
Nor how, nor whence, nor where, nor what she is?
All things without, which round about we see,
We seek to know, and how therewith to do;
But that whereby we reason, live, and be,
Within ourselves we strangers are thereto.
We seek to know the moving of each sphere,
And the strange cause of th'ebbs and floods of Nile;
But of that clock within our breasts we bear,
The subtle motions we forget the while.
We that acquaint ourselves with every zone,
And pass both tropics and behold the poles,
When we come home, are to ourselves unknown,
And unacquainted still with our own souls.
We study speech, but others we persuade;
We leech-craft learn, but others cure with it;
We interpret laws, which other men have made,
But read not those which in our hearts are writ.
Is it because the mind is like the eye,
Through which it gathers knowledge by degrees--
Whose rays reflect not, but spread outwardly--
Not seeing itself when other things it sees?
No, doubtless, for the mind can backward cast
Upon herself her understanding light;
But she is so corrupt and so defaced,
As her own image doth herself affright.
As in the fable of the lady fair,
Which for her lust was turned into a cow:
When thirsty to a stream she did repair,
And saw herself transformed, she wist not how,
At first she startles, then she stands amazed,
At last with terror she from thence doth fly,
And loathes the wat'ry glass wherein she gazed,
And shuns it still, though she for thirst do die.
Even so man's soul, which did God's image bear,
And was at first fair, good, and spotless pure,
Since with her sins her beauties blotted were,
Doth of all sights her own sight least endure.
For even at first reflection she espies
Such strange chimeras and such monsters there,
Such toys, such antics, and such vanities,
As she retires and shrinks for shame and fear.
And as the man loves least at home to be,
So she, impatient her own faults to see,
Turns from herself and in strange things delights.
For this, few know themselves; for merchants broke
View their estate with discontent and pain,
And seas are troubled when they do revoke
Their flowing waves into themselves again.
And while the face of outward things we find
Pleasing and fair, agreeable and sweet,
These things transport and carry out the mind,
That with herself herself can never meet.
Yet if affliction once her wars begin,
And threat the feebler sense with sword and fire,
The mind contracts herself and shrinketh in,
And to herself she gladly doth retire,
As spiders touched seek their webs' inmost part,
As bees in storms unto their hives return,
As blood in danger gathers to the heart,
As men seek towns when foes the country burn.
If aught can teach us aught, affliction's looks,
Making us look into ourselves so near,
Teach us to know ourselves beyond all books,
Or all the learned schools that ever were.
This mistress lately plucked me by the ear,
And many a golden lesson hath me taught;
Hath made my senses quick and reason clear,
Reformed my will and rectified my thought.
So do the winds and thunders cleanse the air;
So working lees settle and purge the wine;
So doth the fire the drossy gold refine.
Neither Minerva nor the learned muse,
Nor rules of art, nor precepts of the wise,
Could in my brain those beams of skill infuse,
As but the glance of this dame's angry eyes.
She within lists my ranging mind hath brought,
That now beyond myself I list not go;
Myself am center of my circling thought,
Only myself I study, learn, and know.
I know my body's of so frail a kind
As force without, fevers within, can kill;
I know the heavenly nature of my nind,
But 'tis corrupted both in wit and will;
I know my soul hath power to know all things,
Yet is she blind and ignorant of all;
I know I am one of nature's little kings,
Yet to the least and vilest things am thrall.
I know my life's a pain and but a span,
I know my sense is mocked with everything;
And to conclude, I know myself a man,
Which is a proud and yet a wretched thing.

I want nothing more than to speak simply, to be granted that grace.

If pain is human we are not human beings merely to suffer pain;
this meaning that moves forward among herbs and greenery
and beasts that graze and drink, men who sow and harvest,
great tombs even and small habitations of the dead.
This current that goes its way and that is not so different from the blood of men,
from the eyes of men when they look straight ahead without fear in their hearts,
without the daily tremor for trivialities or even for important things;
when they look straight ahead like the traveller who is used to gauging his way by the stars,
not like us, the other day, gazing at the enclosed garden of a sleepy Arab house,
behind the lattices the cool garden changing shape, growing larger and smaller,
we too changing, as we gazed, the shape of our desire and our hearts,
caught in the embroidered nets of a life that was as it should be and then became dust and sank into the sands
leaving behind it only that vague dizzying sway of a tall palm tree.

and carried on doing it 
abrupt as that held in the breath
exhausted just before the witch confesses

to bend and lengthen the neck for his ax
before it loosely as leaves in a stream
He linked arms with another
dragging through darkness thick with sand and water and noise
Pressed all night to the porch of the storm his ear 

That the fury never ended he would learn
walking the eye of its silence

was the anchored ship
for such mirth
it would return to that green oak it once had been

In what hour of what night did he know his soul
to turn a stranger to him

than a hide rigid with gore & soil to be 

Daily he marched his men into corrugations of
of gold & corn made by guides snatched from villages 
restored for ransoms of melons or fish

Often some chief would repeat his good friend
& legible to their sense as the amber & musk that steamed
from these his fine furs

His dwindling force
like mayflies in their brevity & towarding and never
Each inquisitor humiliated
the silence

he amassed his ocherous archive of blister
atlas of faith in blood & smoke redrawn

Still even the most exacting map dreams
omits & lies brindled

Every step makes him more wilderness
He goes interiorly
sinew & flint between ragged bands
that command them to bury their sons alive
Girls whose marriages would multiply their foes 
of dog-headed warriors
bucked by pain onto the dirt when wives gave birth
again in no essential changed

Had any man traveled farther than he

From desert skies could be harvested evanescing 
when for two months the natives drank bad water
and ate only oysters
deer dung but also many days without
To suffer only this much
which deposits eggs in the walking nursery of a spider

A single brief season happy to know enough
everyone was summoned by neat cornet-shaped fruits
from parrot through orchid
The pangs can shrink but never close

intangible economy of magic
increased by use

Fright filled some with a lassitude they withered on
Blessing each joint with a cross and that something
of him might be spent on the hurt
like a kingfisher 
under the shadow of the vaulting falcon that played it 
fire

How much can I change before I am changed
without abradings of any other to recall him

Natives said he could not be 
as if where women & men had stood was

neither their stone houses
pierced by some small passive wingless insect
would concealed suckle & multiply its question
down a thousand generations
he was that

Without armor or felted wool or hide afterward
he was now discovered
to manifold injury & errand

A channel for pain and a channel for hearing

a fine method, if you lived in a country
where stones were smooth.

They told the old ones, you are wasting your time.
They prayed for Allah to mend their brains,
for the twig, the round moon,

And occasionally there would be one
who did none of this,
who beat everyone at dominoes,
and was famous for his laugh.

In these deep solitudes and awful cells,
Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells,
And ever-musing melancholy reigns;
What means this tumult in a vestal's veins?
Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?
Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?
And Eloisa yet must kiss the name.

had just killed my brother, so the pain I'm talking about 
was my body's. I breathed up another pain that day. 
I checked the man's beat pickup; why would he want them, 
those skunks knee-deep in its bed? I left the lot

 still more confused, my sweet retriever shivering 
on the seat beside me. The godawful smell still clung 
to the dog's wet coat, and my own. There'd be no more hikes 
for us that morning: rain had arrived, bone-chilling. 
If you killed a skunk, why would you keep the thing? 

To kill some time, I stopped at The Jackpot View. 
We've always called it that. Five mountaintops bled 
into mists to my east in New Hampshire. The sudden squalls 
spilled leaves on the woods-floor's pall of nondescript hue. 
Now he was dead. Now my brother was dead.

 I can't define any God, but only this morning, 
I caught a whiff of road-killed skunk and thought
 I could speak of Him or Her or It as surely 
as I could tell you the slightest thing concerning 
the man I'm remembering now, the one who shot 

or trapped or clubbed those miserable reeking creatures. 
The smallest enigmas we ever encounter remain 
as hard to explain as all the epical ones. 
I've failed for years to fathom the death of my brother; 
but it's just as hard to understand why a scene 

in an old Vermont store should linger like dead-skunk odor,
 which if you've lately been tainted comes back to scent you 
 you may have thought you'd forever gotten over, 
but which at some odd prompting come back to haunt you.

1

Processionals in the exemplary cave,
Benediction of shadows. Pomfret. London.
The voice fragrant with mannered humility,
With an equable contempt for this world,
Struck down into a meaty conduit of blood.
So these dispose themselves to receive each
Pentecostal blow from axe or seraph,
Spattering block-straw with mortal residue.
Psalteries whine through the empyrean. Fire
Flares in the pit, ghosting upon stone
Creatures of such rampant state, vacuous
Ceremony of possession, restless

2

For none but the ritual king? We meditate
A rueful mystery; we are dying
To satisfy fat Caritas, those
Wiped jaws of stone. (Suppose all reconciled
By silent music; imagine the future
Flashed back at us, like steel against sun,
Ultimate recompense.) Recall the cold
Of Towton on Palm Sunday before dawn,
Wakefield, Tewkesbury: fastidious trumpets
Shrilling into the ruck; some trampled
Acres, parched, sodden or blanched by sleet,
Flurrying, darkness over the human mire.

3

They bespoke doomsday and they meant it by
God, their curved metal rimming the low ridge.
But few appearances are like this. Once
Over-riding stillness might reveal men
In such array, livid and featureless,
With England crouched beastwise beneath it all.
After battle utters its own sound
Which is like nothing on earth, but is earth.
Blindly the questing snail, vulnerable
Mole emerge, blindly we lie down, blindly
Among carnage the most delicate souls

4

Let mind be more precious than soul; it will not
Endure. Soul grasps its price, begs its own peace,
Settles with tears and sweat, is possibly
Indestructible. That I can believe.
Though I would scorn the mere instinct of faith,
Expediency of assent, if I dared,
What I dare not is a waste history
Or void rule. Averroes, old heathen,
If only you had been right, if Intellect
Itself were absolute law, sufficient grace,
Our lives could be a myth of captivity
Which we might enter: an unpeopled region
Of ever new-fallen snow, a palace blazing
With perpetual silence as with torches.

5

As with torches we go, at wild Christmas,
When we revel in our atonement
Through thirty feasts of unction and slaughter,
So many things rest under consummate
Justice as though trumpets purified law,
Spikenard were the real essence of remorse.
The sky gathers up darkness. When we chant
Seraphs who descend to pity but ourselves.
Those righteously-accused those vengeful
Racked on articulate looms indulge us
With lingering shows of pain, a flagrant
Tenderness of the damned for their own flesh:

6

My little son, when you could command marvels
Without mercy, outstare the wearisome
A stranger well-received in your kingdom.
On those pristine fields I saw humankind
As it was named by the Father; fabulous
Beasts rearing in stillness to be blessed.
From remote storms, rumour of solitudes,
A composed mystery. And so it ends.
Some parch for what they were; others are made
Blind to all but one vision, their necessity
To be reconciled. I believe in my
Abandonment, since it is what I have.

7

It seemed I stared at them, they at me.
As the armies met, each mirrored the other;
Neither was outshone. So they flashed and vanished
And all that survived them was the stark ground
Of this pain. I made no sound, but once
I stiffened as though a remote cry
Reddish ice tinged the reeds; dislodged, a few
Feathers drifted across; carrion birds
Strutted upon the armour of the dead.

8

Not as we are but as we must appear,
Contractual ghosts of pity; not as we
Desire life but as they would have us live,
Set apart in timeless colloquy.
So it is required; so we bear witness,
Despite ourselves, to what is beyond us,
Each distant sphere of harmony forever
Poised, unanswerable. If it is without
Consequence when we vaunt and suffer, or
If it is not, all echoes are the same
In such eternity. Then tell me, love,
Dragged half-unnerved out of this worldly place,

couldn't stand to see these new young faces, these
bragging about how she didn't give a damn about the
kid and was going back to her boyfriend and be a
would our bodies be the same? could we hide among the
childless? she always reminded me of a lady at the bridge
club in her mother's shoes, playing her mother's hand.

i tried to get along, be silent, stay in my own corner.
but being drawn to the room down the hall, the t.v. room
where, at night, we sat in our cuddly cotton robes and
waiting to be sprung.

one girl, taller and older, twenty-six or twenty-seven, kept
to herself, talked with a funny accent, the pain on her face
seemed worse than ours. . .
said an unkind word to anyone, went to church every morning
with her rosary and prayed each night alone in her room.

she was seventeen, diabetic, fearful that she or the baby

i couldn't believe the fear, the knowledge she had of
the center of strength; death seemed remote, i could not
imagine it walking in our midst, death in the midst of
was lying. . .

gone into labor so the girls had two of us to cheer about.

had reassured her everything was fine.

meanwhile i worked in the laundry, folded the hospital
stepping off the elevator, going up, feeling something,
such a luminous smile, the whole world must be happy.

or out with those crazy girls, those teenagers, laughing,
on a christmas shopping spree, free (the only day they
let us out in two months), feet wet and cold from snow.

i felt pretty, body wide and still in black beatnik
young body like iron.

myself, book propped open on the floor, puffing and
counting while all the sixteen-year-old unwed children
smiled like i was crazy.

one day i got a letter from my cousin, said:

you'll never be complete again
you'll always worry where and how it is

of grief and shame!

would not hurt like all those women who screamed and
peasants in the field, shift my baby to my back, and
continue

when my water broke, when i saw that stain of pink blood
on the toilet paper and felt the first thing i could not
feel, had no control of, dripping down my leg, i heard
them singing mitch miller xmas songs and came from the
the long moment when no one knew but me. it was time.

the one who told them to be tough, to stop believing
that it was beautiful and right and good!

all night i pictured the girls up there, at first hanging
out of the windows, trying to get a glimpse of me. . .
when the pain was worst, i thought of their sleeping faces,
onto that image of innocence like one light in the darkness.

1
Nowhere is all around us, pressureless,
A vacuum waiting for a rupture in
The tegument, a puncture in the skin,
To pass inside without a password and
Implode us into Erewhon. This room
Is dangerously unguarded: in one wall
An empty elevator clangs its doors,
Imperiously, for fodder; in the hall,
Bare stretchers gape for commerce; in the air
Outside, a trembling, empty brightness falls
In hunger on those whom it would devour
Like any sparrow hawk as darkness falls
And rises silently up the steel stairs
To the eleventh and last floor, where I
Reside on sufferance of authorities
Until my visas wither, and I die.
2
Where is my friend, Rodonda Morton Schiff,
Whose hulk breasts, cygnet-like, the Totensee,
The Almirante of the Doldrums in
Her scuttling vessel with such poems as just
Escape confounding his gaunt rape with lust?
She should be singing my song at this hour.
3
It is a simple matter to be brave
Credits have faded in the final crawl,
To which the audience has turned its back
And mumbled, shuffled, struggled into coats
On its way out to face a different night;
It is far harder, in the light of day,
Surrounded by striped student nurses, to
Endure a slight procedure in which you
Are the anatomy lesson in pink paint
Splashed by some master on the tinctured air,
Complete, in gross detail, to the grimace
Denoted by a squiggle on your face
As the bone-marrow needle sinks its fang
Through atomies of drugged and dullard skin
And subcutaneum to pierce the thin,
Up sips of specimen tissue with a pain
Akin to an extraction under gas,
All gravity against all hollowness.
This episode in silent dignity
Or bloodless banter; I must sweat and grunt
And moan in corporal fear of corporal pain
Too venial to be mortal, making a fool
Of my lay figure in its textbook pose
(Fig. 1) before these starched and giggling girls
Too young to be let out of simpering school
To meet live terror face to face and lose.
4
Why must the young male nurse who preps the plain
With his conversant razor, talking snicks
Of scything into my sedated ears,
Talk also in his flat and friendly voice,
Of reassurance, learnt by classroom rote?
It is that he must make his living, too.
5
If Hell abides on earth this must be it:
This too-bright-lit-at-all-hours-of-the-day-
And-night recovery room, where nurses flit
In stroboscopic steps between the beds
All cheek by jowl that hold recoverers
Suspended in the grog of half-damped pain
And tubularities of light-blue light.
For condiment in this mulled mix, there are
Assorted groans and screams; and, lest repose
Outstrip the sufferer, there is his own
Throat-filling Gobi, mucous membrane gone
Dry as Arabia, as barren of
Hydropsy as a sunburnt cage of bone
Perched on parched rocks where game Parcheesian
(A devil figure, this) went, wended his
Bent way to harvest, for a shekel, rugs,
And pack them back by camel over sands
Of nightmare to transship to richer lands
Where millions of small rills plash into streams
Afflict the desiccate on their interminable way
Up through the layers of half-light to day.
6
The riddle of the Sphinx. Man walks on three
Legs at the last. I walk on three, one of
Which is a wheeled I.V. pole, when I rise
From bed the first time to make my aged way
Into the toilet, where, while my legs sway
And the pole sways, swinging its censer high,
I wait to urinate, and cannot make
My mortal coils distill a drop, as time
Stumps past and leaves me swaying there. Defeat:
I roll and hobble back to bed, to the
Refrain of cheeping wheels. Soon the young man
Will come to see me and supply the lack
Of my drugged muscles with the gravity
A beige bag clipped to the bedside, one of
As a condition of continuance.
The body swells until it duns the mind
With importunities in this refined,
White-sheeted torture, practiced by a kind,
Withdrawn white face trained in the arts of love.
7
Home, and the lees of autumn scuttle up
To my halt feet: fat, sportive maple leaves
Struck into ochre by the frost and stripped
From their umbilic cords to skate across
The blacktop drive and fetch up on my shoes
As if including me in their great fall,
Windy with rumors of the coming ice.
Though fallen, frostbit, yellowed also, I
Cannot participate in their late game
But must leave them to hide and seek a place
To decompose in, while I clamber up
Long enneads of stairs to the room where
A world of voices and surprises, for
From indefatigable spinnerets,
Until her sister widows, having set
The norms for length and texture of each strand
And sharpened their gross shears, come cut it off
And send me to befriend the winter leaves.

Not so far away, a scream so rending that to hear it is to be
Frozen mold and insist that they too, like mouse-eared chickweed,
And the myriad lines that criss-cross tell the story of nearly fifty
Rearing up and offices like monuments and crowds lined up to see
Quote from Aeschylus: I forget. All, all is forgotten gradually and
One wonders if these ideas that seem handed down are truly what they were?
Gull coasts by, unexpected as a kiss on the nape of the neck. These
Mysterious than that, pierced by blue or running in the rain
Bring no pleasure: arduous truths to tell. And if you thought March was bad
With depth to it. That is like pain, ordinary household pain,
Like piles, or bumping against a hernia. All the signs are set for A OK
To cardinals? I hear them call. Plaintively, in the mating season.
To see. And there are sights to hear, music from a phonograph, pop
Is how the light becomes entrapped in a dusty screen, masking out
The view into the depths of the garage where the cars are stalled like oxen.
Day, suddenly sunny and warming up for more, I would like to stroke you
As one strokes a cat and feels the ridgy skull beneath the fur and tickles
It behind its ears. The cat twists its head and moves it toward your fingers
The sun strokes all now in this zone, reaching in through windows to jell
Ungathered up. I hate fussing with nature and would like the world to be
Thrive. So much messing about, why not leave the world alone? Then
There would be no books, which is not to be borne. Willa Cather alone is worth
The greatest paintings. Preferred orchestral conductors. Nostalgia singers.
Love: the boy who opts for trade school while white collar kids
Stamp an impression on them. It is quite other. They stamp us, both
And yellow and warm as lit gas jets, clinging like bees to
And just before the snap of temper one had sensed so

The startling pleasures all broke down,
It was her first arthritic spring.
Inside her furs, her bones, secure,
Suddenly became a source of pain
And froze on a Saturday afternoon

Strength had been her weakness, and
Because it was, she got to like
The exhilaration of catastrophes
That prove our lives as stupid as we think,
But pain, more stupid than stupidity,
Is an accident of animals in which, once caught,
The distances are never again the same.

Yet there was another Jane in Jane:
She smelled the inside of a logarithm,
And felt a Gothic arch rise in her chest,
Her clavicle widening to bear the weight
Of the two smooth plumb lines of her breasts,
The blueprints forming an enormous skirt
Around her body. Arch and star and cross
Swung like little lights inside her head,
A church and temple rising from the floor,
Nave and transept and an altar where,
Unbidden, she saw a kind of sacrifice;
The knife was in her hand, the stick, the whip;
She cried at her cruelty and cried to be
Outside of her defenses. And just then,

The windows buckled in, the paintings cracked,
The furniture went walking by itself,
All out of her control. And it was pain
That let her know she was herself again:
She wore a cloak of fire on her skin,
And power, power floated up to her.

The courage to abandon the graves dug into the hill,
the small bones of children and the brittle bones
of the old whose marrow hunger had stolen;
the courage to desert the tree planted and only
begun to bear; the riverside where promises were
shaped; the street where their empty pots were broken.
 
The courage to leave the place whose language you learned
as early as your own, whose customs however dan-
gerous or demeaning, bind you like a halter
you have learned to pull inside, to move your load;
the land fertile with the blood spilled on it;
the roads mapped and annotated for survival.
 
The courage to walk out of the pain that is known
into the pain that cannot be imagined,
mapless, walking into the wilderness, going
barefoot with a canteen into the desert;
stuffed in the stinking hold of a rotting ship
 
Cathay, India, Siberia, goldeneh medina2 
leaving bodies by the way like abandoned treasure.
So they walked out of Egypt.3 So they bribed their way
out of Russia under loads of straw; so they steamed
out of the bloody smoking charnelhouse of Europe
 
out of pain into death or freedom or a different
painful dignity, into squalor and politics.
We Jews are all born of wanderers, with shoes
under our pillows and a memory of blood that is ours
raining down. We honor only those Jews who changed
tonight, those who chose the desert over bondage,
 
who walked into the strange and became strangers
and gave birth to children who could look down
on them standing on their shoulders for having
been slaves. We honor those who let go of every-
thing but freedom, who ran, who revolted, who fought,
who became other by saving themselves.

I don't want to be alive anymore.
I don't want to be alive enough to want that.

One is not meant to turn on one's creator
with ferocity expendable in only one way.

Or is that exactly how one is meant to turn
to burn
beyond the love that from beyond being
has come to us:

Christ's ever unhearable
and thus always too bearable
scream.

In love and dread we learn to listen
for beloved dread

coming upon us like a whiplash rain
we watch through a window.

In pain we learn pain.

Sometimes amid the rancid moonlight and mindlice of my insomnia
there gleams a scalpel blade

so clean with meaning
so shaped and sharpened to interstellar blue

across my own throat

there comes not blood but an ancient answering
starlight.

Once upon a time in a pleasingly modern slaughterhospice
with a view of sky-contempted skyscrapers

and Lake Michigan's immaculate sewage
my inner skin was skinned mouth to bowels,

For self-pity there must remain a self.

one still finds one's self hastening to hide it all
from the kind Ukranian nearly bearded night nurse.

Fentanyl patches patching my stalactite thighs
my diaphanous shoulders

the very air eating me
like a late leaf

that once I would have flourished
for a perishable lover

into a poem.

Dead brain, living will, little pills
entangling pain with adoration of it,

morphine machine whose little beep
(heavenly bell)

conjures me to the suddenly more tolerable hallways
of hell . . .

so unsurgically curved,
disclosing as she leans to clean my lines

a bit of icelace undergarment like the very last trace
of a glacier.

The brain the brain the brain flickering electrically
in and out,

not the mind in which I love
my wife

whose tightwound nightmind conjures Christ in diapers,
for instance, filthy infant, or later,

in a mist of adolescent bad weather,
bored of wood, dogdead Judea, squawk-box God,

some restless absurdity of earth, she says,
through which the rest of heaven can come.

Once upon a time I walked through the chemical glamour
of a night refinery

sparking dangerously without and within
for beside me under her underclothes

undulated an incarnation
of creation's finest failure:

moonskin to make a young man wince
coupled with stifling innocence.

Still, we managed.

And over the wrought-iron railing of the country club
to which neither of us could possibly belong,

in the moonskinned pool that seemed both to embody and imbibe
her, we improved.

And later, out on a green (to be sixteen!)
when the starshower I thought was mine

was mining me for sweat, muscle, memory
to make its own death

shine unceasingly inside of me,
even unto hell,

Can it be that her last name was really Key?

So much life in this poem
so much salvageable and saving love

but it is I fear I swear I tear open
what heart I have left

to keep it from being
and beating and bearing down upon me
 

What rest in faith
wrested

What truce
in bowing
down

not to the ground
of being
to the ground

Affliction flickers
distant
like a structure
on fire
reprieve
moves through me

like a breeze

But antlike
crawls all over me Lord
and I cry out
if you call
quiet
this riot
of needs and genes
an I

Feelingly
bones
of sounds
I make my scathing
way
in church
or in the parked
car
I try

What might it mean
to surrender
nothing
Not to end
1.

The dark socket of the year
the pit, the cave where the sun lies down
and threatens never to rise,
when despair descends softly as the snow
covering all paths and choking roads:

then hawkfaced pain seized you
threw you so you fell with a sharp
cry, a knife tearing a bolt of silk.
My father heard the crash but paid
no mind, napping after lunch

yet fifteen hundred miles north
I heard and dropped a dish.
Your pain sunk talons in my skull
and crouched there cawing, heavy
as a great vessel filled with water,

oil or blood, till suddenly next day
the weight lifted and I knew your mind
had guttered out like the Chanukah
candles that burn so fast, weeping
veils of wax down the chanukiya.

Those candles were laid out,
friends invited, ingredients bought
for latkes and apple pancakes,
that holiday for liberation
and the winter solstice

when tops turn like little planets.
Shall you have all or nothing
take half or pass by untouched?
Nothing you got, Nun said the dreydl
as the room stopped spinning.

The angel folded you up like laundry
your body thin as an empty dress.
Your clothes were curtains
hanging on the window of what had
been your flesh and now was glass.

Outside in Florida shopping plazas
loudspeakers blared Christmas carols
and palm trees were decked with blinking
lights. Except by the tourist
hotels, the beaches were empty.

Pelicans with pregnant pouches
flapped overhead like pterodactyls.
In my mind I felt you die.
First the pain lifted and then
you flickered and went out.

2.

I walk through the rooms of memory.
Sometimes everything is shrouded in dropcloths,
every chair ghostly and muted.

Other times memory lights up from within
bustling scenes acted just the other side
of a scrim through which surely I could reach

my fingers tearing at the flimsy curtain

In sleep the other night I met you, seventeen
your first nasty marriage just annulled,
thin from your abortion, clutching a book

against your cheek and trying to look
older, trying to look middle class,

dressing for parties in cast off
stage costumes of your sisters. Your eyes
were hazy with dreams. You did not

notice me waving as you wandered
past and I saw your slip was showing.
You stood still while I fixed your clothes,

as if I were your mother. Remember me
combing your springy black hair, ringlets
that seemed metallic, glittering;

remember me dressing you, my seventy year
old mother who was my last dollbaby,
giving you too late what your youth had wanted.

3.

What is this mask of skin we wear,
what is this dress of flesh,
this coat of few colors and little hair?

This voluptuous seething heap of desires
and fears, squeaking mice turned up
in a steaming haystack with their babies?

This coat has been handed down, an heirloom
this coat of black hair and ample flesh,
this coat of pale slightly ruddy skin.

This set of hips and thighs, these buttocks
they provided cushioning for my grandmother
Hannah, for my mother Bert and for me

and we all sat on them in turn, those major
muscles on which we walk and walk and walk
over the earth in search of peace and plenty.

My mother is my mirror and I am hers.
What do we see? Our face grown young again,
our breasts grown firm, legs lean and elegant.

Our arms quivering with fat, eyes
set in the bark of wrinkles, hands puffy,
our belly seamed with childbearing,

Give me your dress that I might try it on.
Oh it will not fit you mother, you are too fat.
I will not fit you mother.

I will not be the bride you can dress,
the obedient dutiful daughter you would chew,

You strike me sometimes just to hear the sound.
Loneliness turns your fingers into hooks
barbed and drawing blood with their caress.

My twin, my sister, my lost love,
I carry you in me like an embryo
as once you carried me.

4.

What is it we turn from, what is it we fear?
Did I truly think you could put me back inside?
Did I think I would fall into you as into a molten
furnace and be recast, that I would become you?

What did you fear in me, the child who wore
your hair, the woman who let that black hair
grow long as a banner of darkness, when you
a proper flapper wore yours cropped?

You pushed and you pulled on my rubbery
flesh, you kneaded me like a ball of dough.
Rise, rise, and then you pounded me flat.
Secretly the bones formed in the bread.

I became willful, private as a cat.
You never knew what alleys I had wandered.
You called me bad and I posed like a gutter
queen in a dress sewn of knives.

All I feared was being stuck in a box
with a lid. A good woman appeared to me
indistinguishable from a dead one
except that she worked all the time.

Your payday never came. Your dreams ran
with bright colors like Mexican cottons
that bled onto the drab sheets of the day
and would not bleach with scrubbing.

My dear, what you said was one thing
but what you sang was another, sweetly
subversive and dark as blackberries
and I became the daughter of your dream.

This body is your body, ashes now
and roses, but alive in my eyes, my breasts,
my throat, my thighs. You run in me
a tang of salt in the creek waters of my blood,

you sing in my mind like wine. What you
did not dare in your life you dare in mine.
1. deathbed

There is a word that is not water,
has nothing to do with heat or light,
is unrelated to any one pain
though the torn body tears itself further
trying to speak it.
beyond all the sounds that I have made,
the needs that one by one I've tried to name.
It burns clear in the eyes searching mine,
the lips beginning to bleed again,
her hand squeezing my hand,
pleading and pleading that I understand.

2. living will

All afternoon in the afterlife
of little things that love,
or pain, or need could not let go of
I hunt for the will
that will let me let you go.

all the grainy faces
in old photographs, letters
from the dead, deeds to places
that are only air,

some bright nowhere
of broad fields and sunlight
that was my idea of heaven
one long afternoon
of clouds and steady rain

when you sat and explained
where a garden was, a well,
excited by it, the hell
ahead of you
just a brief tightness at your heart.

Outside in the yard, crickets start,
cry here and here and here, 
night's thousand shadows growing tall.
And now I have it, formal, final.
I touch each keepsake like a wall.

3. going

In the hard light and hum
of the room to which I've come
to stay, I watch the clock,
and wait, and hour by hour
begin to disappear.
Movements, mutterings: the brain
darkens like a landscape. Pain
in the pale arterial hills
flashes and vanishes,
takes with it one whole year.
Cotton and killdeer, a cloud
looks down, something's happened
in the wellhouse, someone runs
through tall trees, breathe and breathe,
is it my hand you hold?
The fever climbs. You grow cold,
then warm, now cold again,
a hive of nerves in the skin.
Some glimmer breaks through
and I bend whispering as fear
like a wind shakes you,
I'm right here, I'm right here...

Midnight, moonlight gauzing
the walls, the iron and umber
of intensive care:
I watch as it swells and falls
the puttied scar at your heart,
and read each beat and falter
on a screen and match my breathing
to the breathing of a machine
to know this time as it passes,
until, early, you shudder
and quieten, blood gases
begin to rapidly rise
and somewhere behind your eyes
I fall in fragments away:
a child surprised at his play,
encroached upon by air,
a shattered man near dawn,
something about the way
he holds so still, his hair.

All meaning from a name!
White houses prank where once were huts.
Glion, but not the same!

All things that love the sun are out of doors; 
The sky rejoices in the morning's birth; 
The hare is running races in her mirth; 
And with her feet she from the plashy earth 
Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun, 
Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run. 

I was a Traveller then upon the moor; 
I saw the hare that raced about with joy; 
I heard the woods and distant waters roar; 
Or heard them not, as happy as a boy: 
The pleasant season did my heart employ: 
My old remembrances went from me wholly; 
And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy. 

But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might 
Of joys in minds that can no further go, 
As high as we have mounted in delight 
In our dejection do we sink as low; 
To me that morning did it happen so; 
And fears and fancies thick upon me came; 

I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky; 
And I bethought me of the playful hare: 
Even such a happy Child of earth am I; 
Even as these blissful creatures do I fare; 
Far from the world I walk, and from all care; 
Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty. 

My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought, 
As if life's business were a summer mood; 
As if all needful things would come unsought 
To genial faith, still rich in genial good; 
But how can He expect that others should 
Build for him, sow for him, and at his call 
Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all? 

I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy, 
The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride; 
Of Him who walked in glory and in joy 
Following his plough, along the mountain-side: 
By our own spirits are we deified: 
We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; 
But thereof come in the end despondency and madness. 

Now, whether it were by peculiar grace, 
A leading from above, a something given, 
Yet it befell that, in this lonely place, 
When I with these untoward thoughts had striven, 
Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven 
I saw a Man before me unawares: 
The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs. 

As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie 
Couched on the bald top of an eminence; 
Wonder to all who do the same espy, 
By what means it could thither come, and whence; 
So that it seems a thing endued with sense: 
Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf 
Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself; 

Such seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead, 
His body was bent double, feet and head 
Coming together in life's pilgrimage; 
As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage 
Of sickness felt by him in times long past, 
A more than human weight upon his frame had cast. 

Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, 
Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood: 
And, still as I drew near with gentle pace, 
Upon the margin of that moorish flood 
Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood, 
That heareth not the loud winds when they call, 
And moveth all together, if it move at all. 

At length, himself unsettling, he the pond 
Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look 
Upon the muddy water, which he conned, 
As if he had been reading in a book: 
And now a stranger's privilege I took; 
And, drawing to his side, to him did say, 
"This morning gives us promise of a glorious day." 

A gentle answer did the old Man make, 
In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: 
And him with further words I thus bespake, 
"What occupation do you there pursue? 
This is a lonesome place for one like you." 
Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise 
Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes. 

His words came feebly, from a feeble chest, 
But each in solemn order followed each, 
Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach 
Of ordinary men; a stately speech; 
Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use, 
Religious men, who give to God and man their dues. 

He told, that to these waters he had come 
To gather leeches, being old and poor: 
Employment hazardous and wearisome! 
And he had many hardships to endure: 
From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor; 
Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance; 
And in this way he gained an honest maintenance. 

The old Man still stood talking by my side; 
But now his voice to me was like a stream 
Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide; 
And the whole body of the Man did seem 
Like one whom I had met with in a dream; 
Or like a man from some far region sent, 
To give me human strength, by apt admonishment. 

My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills; 
And hope that is unwilling to be fed; 
Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills; 
And mighty Poets in their misery dead. 
My question eagerly did I renew, 
"How is it that you live, and what is it you do?" 

He with a smile did then his words repeat; 
And said that, gathering leeches, far and wide 
He travelled; stirring thus about his feet 
The waters of the pools where they abide. 
"Once I could meet with them on every side; 
But they have dwindled long by slow decay; 
Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may." 

While he was talking thus, the lonely place, 
In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace 
About the weary moors continually, 
Wandering about alone and silently. 
While I these thoughts within myself pursued, 
He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed. 

And soon with this he other matter blended, 
Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind, 
But stately in the main; and, when he ended, 
I could have laughed myself to scorn to find 
In that decrepit Man so firm a mind. 
"God," said I, "be my help and stay secure; 
I'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!" 

All day they stream past, petitioners
for understanding, accolade, critique.
I read them all, a vast anthology
of jumbled genres on a common theme:
affliction. So I parse, interpret, scan.
I graph dysrhythmias, dysmetrias;
I eavesdrop on caesuras for unsaid
murmurs, gallops, rubs, snaps, flutters, clicks.
the elephant that squats upon a chest
is not a burning heart or waterbrash.

Just take the imagists. Their heads explode.
St Elmo's fire flashdances on their limbs.
They float, they swim. Knives twist within their flesh.
They're ball-and-chained by lead, filled with concrete.
Butterflies inhabit them. Their pipes
are wrong, and clogged. Their systems freeze and crash.
Invaded, they resist; defenses fail.
What they need, they think, is you to flush
it out of them, whatever it is, doc.

The formalists present minutiae,
from acne, backpain, catarrh, dandruff, eye-
strain, flatfoot, gas pains, hangnail, itchiness,
the jitters, kinks, lethargies, migraines, nose-
bleeds, obstipation, panics, queasy retch-
ings, styes and tremors, ulcers, vertigo,
to wandering womb, xerosis, yaws and zits.

Free versers, on the other hand, wax Walt
Whitmanic: their barbaric yawps celebrate and sing
incantatory songs of themselves, songs
of the breath as it wheezes and rales through them,
the short breath and long breath, the breath that is moist or dry,
songs of the blood, the thick- and thinness of it, its heat, its turbulence,
songs of the gut, its rippling coils, the dark burden of its secret indulgences,
songs of the muscled limb, inflamed with toil or the languid thrash of love.

Didacticists, of course, will always add
their theories of omission or commission:
slept in a draft, got their feet wet, caught a chill,
forgot their overshoes and oversoul,
ate too little roughage, too much ham,
should have pumped less iron or pumped more,
Mea culpa, meus morbus they intone,
certain you'll absolve them back to health.

Narrativists enshrine a fleeting pain
within an epic of chronology
brushed my teeth, ate oatmeal with a pat
of low-fat margarine, the kind that has
the dancing turkey on the tub, on sale
for .99 at Johnnie's, by the time
you tune back in it's afternoon, the pain
has come and gone; they're vacuuming the rug,
the doorbell rings, the kettle's whistling,
through supper, TV, bedtime, dreams, alarm
clock going off at six. Try Tylenol,
you say, your fingers crossed. Call if it's worse.

Then there's the avant garde. The cutting edge.
The text Munchausens off the sizzling page.
Hypoglossalalia muscles in,
between John Cagey silences, the din
and Sturm of wild unsound, unsense.
O, there are stranger dysphasias, Wernicke,
than are dreamt of in your neurologies,
far off the beaten geographic tongue,
where elephants explode and overshoes
it's yours. And that's, of course, the joke. You nod.
You say, "I understand." You really don't.

And the music's not immortal; but the world has made it sweet
And it pulses through the pleasures of the City and the pain

To remember and to recompense the music evermore

Go down to Kew in lilac-time, in lilac-time, in lilac-time;

The cherry-trees are seas of bloom and soft perfume and sweet perfume,

The linnet and the throstle, too, and after dark the long halloo

And when the rose begins to pout and all the chestnut spires are out

Come down to Kew in lilac-time, in lilac-time, in lilac-time;

And in all the gaudy busses there are scores of weary feet
Making time, sweet time, with a dull mechanic beat,

Verdi, Verdi, when you wrote Il Trovatore did you dream
Of the organ and the monkey and the many-coloured stream
On the Picadilly pavement, of the myriad eyes that seem
To be litten for a moment with a wild Italian gleam
As A che la morte parodies the world's eternal theme

There's a thief, perhaps, that listens with a face of frozen stone
There's a portly man of business with a balance of his own,
There's a clerk and there's a butcher of a soft reposeful tone.
And they're all of them returning to the heavens they have known:

There's a very modish woman and her smile is very bland
And her hansom jingles onward, but her little jewelled hand
Is clenched a little tighter and she cannot understand
What she wants or why she wanders to that undiscovered land,
For the parties there are not at all the sort of thing she planned,

There's a rowing man that listens, and his heart is crying out
For the barge, the eight, the Isis, and the coach's whoop and shout,
For the minute-gun, the counting and the long dishevelled rout,
For the howl along the tow-path and a fate that's still in doubt,
For a roughened oar to handle and a race to think about

There's a labourer that listens to the voices of the dead
And his hand begins to tremble and his face to smoulder red,
And stares into the sunset where his April love is fled,
For he hears her softly singing, and his lonely soul is led

There's an old and haggard demi-rep, it's ringing in her ears,
With the wild and empty sorrow of the love that blights and sears,
Oh, and if she hurries onward, then be sure, be sure she hears,
Hears and bears the bitter burden of the unforgotten years,
And her laugh's a little harsher and her eyes are brimmed with tears

There's a barrel-organ carolling across a golden street
Though the music's only Verdi there's a world to make it sweet
Just as yonder yellow sunset where the earth and heaven meet
Mellows all the sooty City! Hark, a hundred thousand feet
Are marching on to glory through the poppies and the wheat

And enriched it with the harmonies that make a song complete
In the deeper heavens of music where the night and morning meet,
And it pulses through the pleasures of the City and the pain

Come down to Kew in lilac-time, in lilac-time, in lilac time;
And you shall wander hand and hand with love in summer's wonderland;

[Introduction] 
Lo now! four other acts upon the stage, 
Childhood, and Youth, the Manly, and Old-age. 
The first: son unto Phlegm, grand-child to water, 
The second: frolic claims his pedigree; 
From blood and air, for hot and moist is he. 
The last, of earth and heavy melancholy, 
Solid, hating all lightness, and all folly. 
His spring was intermixed with some snow. 
Upon his head a Garland Nature set: 
Of Daisy, Primrose, and the Violet. 
Such cold mean flowers (as these) blossom betime, 
His hobby striding, did not ride, but run, 
And in his hand an hour-glass new begun, 
In dangers every moment of a fall, 
But if he held till it have run its last, 
Then may he live till threescore years or past. 
Next, youth came up in gorgeous attire 
(As that fond age, doth most of all desire), 
His Suit of Crimson, and his Scarf of Green. 
Garland of Roses, Pinks, and Gillyflowers 
His face as fresh, as is Aurora fair, 
He seems to fly, or swim, and not to ride. 
Then prancing on the Stage, about he wheels; 
But as he went, death waited at his heels. 
The next came up, in a more graver sort, 
As one that cared for a good report. 
Of Autumn fruits a basket on his arm, 
And last of all, to act upon this Stage, 
Leaning upon his staff, comes up old age. 
Under his arm a Sheaf of wheat he bore, 
A Harvest of the best: what needs he more? 
This writ about: This out, then I am done. 
His hoary hairs and grave aspect made way, 
And all gave ear to what he had to say. 
These being met, each in his equipage 
Intend to speak, according to their age, 
But wise Old-age did with all gravity 
To childish childhood give precedency, 
And to the rest, his reason mildly told: 
That he was young, before he grew so old. 
To do as he, the rest full soon assents, 
Their method was that of the Elements, 
That each should tell what of himself he knew, 
With heed now stood, three ages of frail man, 
To hear the child, who crying, thus began. 

Childhood 
A nothing, here to day, but gone to morrow, 
But night and darkness must with shame conceal. 
To shew her bearing pangs, I should do wrong, 
With tears into this world I did arrive; 
My mother still did waste, as I did thrive, 
Who yet with love and all alacity, 
Spending was willing to be spent for me. 
With wayward cries, I did disturb her rest, 
Who sought still to appease me with her breast; 
When wretched I (ungrate) had done the wrong. 
When Infancy was past, my Childishness 
Did act all folly that it could express. 
My silliness did only take delight, 
In that which riper age did scorn and slight, 
In Rattles, Bables, and such toyish stuff. 
My then ambitious thoughts were low enough. 
That its own worth it did not know nor mind. 
This little house of flesh did spacious count, 
Through ignorance, all troubles did surmount, 
Yet this advantage had mine ignorance, 
Freedom from Envy and from Arrogance. 
How to be rich, or great, I did not cark, 
Nor studious was, Kings favours how to buy, 
With costly presents, or base flattery; 
No office coveted, wherein I might 
Make strong my self and turn aside weak right. 
No malice bare to this or that great Peer, 
Nor unto buzzing whisperers gave ear. 
I gave no hand, nor vote, for death, of life. 
My quarrels, not for Diadems, did rise, 
But for an Apple, Plumb, or some such prize. 
My strokes did cause no death, nor wounds, nor scars. 
My little wrath did cease soon as my wars. 
My duel was no challenge, nor did seek. 
My foe should weltering, with his bowels reek. 
I had no Suits at law, neighbours to vex, 
Nor evidence for land did me perplex. 
I had no ships at Sea, no fraughts to loose. 
Nor yet on future things did place my hope. 
This was mine innocence, but oh the seeds 
Lay raked up of all the cursed weeds, 
Which sprouted forth in my insuing age, 
As he can tell, that next comes on the stage. 
But yet me let me relate, before I go, 
The sins and dangers I am subject to: 
A lying tongue as soon as it could speak 
And fifth Commandment do daily break; 
Oft stubborn, peevish, sullen, pout, and cry; 
Then nought can please, and yet I know not why. 
As many was my sins, so dangers too, 
For sin brings sorrow, sickness, death, and woe, 
And though I miss the tossings of the mind, 
Yet griefs in my frail flesh I still do find. 
What gripes of wind, mine infancy did pain? 
What tortures I, in breeding teeth sustain? 
What crudities my cold stomach hath bred? 
Whence vomits, worms, and flux have issued? 
What breaches, knocks, and falls I daily have? 
And some perhaps, I carry to my grave. 
Sometimes in fire, sometimes in water fall: 

Youth 
My goodly clothing and beauteous skin 
Declare some greater riches are within, 
And then the worst, in a more ugly hue, 
For thus to do we on this Stage assemble, 
Then let not him, which hath most craft dissemble. 
As might my self, and others, profit much: 
Of Science, Arts, and Tongues, I know the rules; 
The manners of the Court, I likewise know, 
Nor ignorant what they in Country do. 
The brave attempts of valiant Knights I prize 
The snorting Horse, the Trumpet, Drum I like, 
I cannot lie in trench before a Town, 
Nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown. 
I scorn the heavy Corslet, Musket-proof; 
Though thus in field, at home, to all most kind, 
So affable that I do suit each mind, 
I can insinuate into the breast 
And by my mirth can raise the heart deprest. 
Sweet Music rapteth my harmonious Soul, 
And elevates my thoughts above the Pole. 
My wit, my bounty, and my courtesy 
Makes all to place their future hopes on me. 
This is my best, but youth (is known) alas, 
To be as wild as is the snuffing Ass, 
As vain as froth, as vanity can be, 
That who would see vain man may look on me: 
My wit evaporates in merriment; 
But doing so, might seem magnanimous. 
I know no Law, nor reason, but my will; 
Sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse 
Sometimes I cheat (unkind) a female Heir 
Of all at once, who not so wise, as fair, 
Trusteth my loving looks and glozing tongue 
Until mine own be gone, my wit, and wealth. 
From pipe to pot, from pot to words and blows, 
For he that loveth Wine wanteth no woes. 
Days, nights, with Ruffins, Roarers, Fiddlers spend, 
To all obscenity my ears I bend, 
All counsel hate which tends to make me wise, 
And dearest friends count for mine enemies. 
I

The ground dove stuttered for a few steps then flew
up from his path to settle in the sun-browned
branches that were now barely twigs; in drought it coos
with its relentless valve, a tiring sound,
not like the sweet exchanges of turtles in the Song
of Solomon, or the flutes of Venus in frescoes
though all the mounds in the dove-calling drought
the hills and gulches all briary and ochre
and the small dervishes that swivelled in the dust
were like an umber study for a fresco
of The Prodigal Son, this scorched, barren acre.
He had the smell of cities in his clothes,
the steam and soot of trains of Fascist stations
and their resounding vaults, he had the memory of rain
carried in his head, the rain on Pescara's beach
with the pastel hotels, and instead of the doves
the air-show with the jets soaring and swooping
over the Fair, the smell off that beach
came back on the rock-road where the turtle lifted
its mating music into the dry acacias,
and mixed with the smell off the galloping sea-flock,
each odour distinct, of sheep trampling their pens
as if their fear had caught the wolf-scent.

The rock-brown dove had fluttered from that fear
would panic and forget him from the change
of character that the grunting swine could smell.
A sow and her litter. Acknowledged prodigal.

Grey sunrise through a sky of frosted glass,
the great trees sodden, the paths below them pooled,
the headlands veiled and muslin-thin, no birds,
and pale green combers cresting through the drizzle;
a change of climate, the clouding of the self
in a sudden culture but one more confident
in its glazed equestrian statues in wet parks,
its railway stations echoing like the combers
in the ground-shaken caves under the cliff;
gathering, cresting then dissolving shallows
as light steps quietly into the house.
Light that inaudibly fits in the house
as a book on a bookshelf with its spines of tombs
and names, mouths slightly parted, eager to speak
wherever their station now. Every library
is a cemetery in sunlight. Sometimes, a shaft . . .

Across the dry hillock, leaves chasing dead leaves
in resurrecting gusts, or in the ochre quiet
leaves too many to rake on the road's margins,
too loaded to lift themselves, they lapsed singly
or in a yellow chute from the cedar, burnt branches;
lyres of desiccation choked the dry gutters
by the caked track to Saltibus, over D'ennery.
Drought. Song of the wireless harp of the frangipani
that still makes a tangled music out of silence.

II

Now to cherish the depredations of April
the gommier maudit unshouldering its leaves,
barrow after loaded barrow, the leaves fading, yellow,
burnt grass and the tigerish shadows on the hillside,
and the azure a trowelled blue, and blue hill-smoke,
parched shortcuts and rust, cattle anchored in shadows
and groaning like winches, the didactic drought
against the hot sea that teaches what? Thirst
for the grace that springs in grooves of oblivious dust.

A fine haze screens the headland, the drizzle drifts.
Is every noun: breakwater, headland, haze,
seen through a gauze of English, a bright scrim,
a mesh in which light now defines the wires
and not its natural language? Were your life and work
simply a good translation? Would headland,
haze and the spray-wracked breakwater
pronounce their own names differently?
And have I looked at life, in other words,
through some inoperable cataract?
"What language do you speak in your own country?"
Every noun has its echo, a noun is a noise,
as every stone in the expanding sunlight
finds an exact translation in its shadow,
and it may be that you were halved by language
of Greenwich or by Pope Alexander's line,
but what makes this, if this is all it is,
more than just bearable, in fact, exultation
is the stone that is looked at, and the manchineels,
bitter, poisonous yellow berries, treacherous apples
that look like Eden's on the tree of knowledge
when the first noun was picked and named and eaten
and the shadow of knowledge defined every edge
originating language and then difference,
and subtlety, the snake and contradiction
and the sudden Babel of the manchineel.

III

The blank page grows a visionary wood.
A parallel section, no, in fact a whole province
of far, of foreign, of self-translating leaves
stands on the place where it has always stood
the right-hand margin of the page
loud, soft but voluble in their original language,
going far back in time and deep in roots
and echoing in the tunnel of the right ear
with echoes: oak-echo, beech-echo, linden-echo,
and beech and birds a half-ancestral forest
whose metre was an ocean's and whose break,
parting declared the white-lined conjugation
of combers' centuries. This ocean, English and this forest weald,
this clattering natterer "burn," this distance, mist,
kept its high columns marching as my pen moves
towards that gap of light that comes upon
the bright salt arc of a bare unprinted beach
or where the piper leaves a print, its claws,
that is the landscape, that, the stand of forest
made up of all these leaves and lines that
still rasp with delight with rhyme and incantation
pages of shade turning into translation.
And my left hand another vegetation
but not their opposite or their enemy,
palms and wild fern and praising them, the sea,
sea-almond, grape and vine and agave
that the wind's finger folded carefully
drawing its thumb to mark the dog-eared wave
across the dry hill, leaves chasing leaves
in a shiny, scurrying wind, and, in the brown quiet,
leaves, unraked, tiling the road's margins,
so loaded they don't lift, they lapse singly, yellow,
or chute from the cedars. Lyres of desiccation
in March's autumn, filling the dry gutters,
except for the wireless harp of the frangipani
that still makes its music out of extreme stillness.
In my own botanic origins, frangere panem
to break bread, flower-flour in its white lilies,
except that in rare blossom I now remember
the flower is pink. It doesn't matter.
Since whatever hue it is, its wafer it serves that need,
petal on the sky's open palate at early mass
every morning but here most on this Sunday
with its Lenten drought, the heart-coloured flowers then
the caterpillars determinedly devour,
on a Sunday when a sadness still eats at the parallel
petals of my beaten heart, and the white pews of the sea,
the waves coming in aisles, my longing
for the communion of breakfast, the leafless,
flower-less but crusted bark of the frangipani,
frangere panem, the pain that I break and eat
flower and flour, pain and pain,
bright Easter coming, like the seas white communion.

IV

In the country of the ochre afternoon
it is always still and hot, the dry leaves stirring
infrequently sometimes with the rattling pods
of what they call "women's tongues," in
the afternoon country the far hills are very quiet
and heat-hazed, but mostly in the middle
of the country of the afternoon I see the brown heat
of the skin of my first love, so still, so perfect,
so unaltered, and I see how she walked
with her sunburnt hands against the still sea-almonds,
that was when I thought we were immortal
and that love would be folded doves and folded oars
and water lapping against eroding stone
in the ochre country of the afternoon.

1 Adios, Carenage

In idle August, while the sea soft,
as I went downhill, and I nearly said:
above Laventille pink as the gown
in which the woman I left was sleeping,
exactly like me, and the man was weeping

But they had started to poison my soul
I had a sound colonial education,

watching the sea heaving up and down
signing her name with every reflection;
I knew when dark-haired evening put on
so I smile to myself as the bow rope untied
that kills them, as drowned sailors the sea.

But let me tell you how this business begin.

2 Raptures of the Deep

and the Spanish pirogues always met us halfway,
for her laces and silks, Maria Concepcion.
Ay, ay! Next thing I hear, some Commission of Inquiry
was being organized to conduct a big quiz,
I was so broke all I needed was shades and a cup
or four shades and four cups in four-cup Port of Spain;
all the silver I had was the coins on the sea.

and the Scotch pouring in through the back door.
As for that minister-monster who smuggled the booze,
that half-Syrian saurian, I got so vex to see
like a dinosaur caked with primordial ooze

whose ceiling rippled like a silk tent,
I wept under water, salt seeking salt,
cleaving me from my children, flesh of my flesh!

the hurt I had done to my wife and children,
where I could rest, like the pelicans know,
so I got raptures once, and I saw God
Where is the pillow I will not have to pay for,
and the window I can look from that frames my life?

3 Shabine Leaves the Republic

I had no nation now but the imagination.
when the power swing to their side.
a spray-plane Air Force, the Fire Brigade,
a parchment Creole, with warts
like an old sea bottle, crawling like a crab
through the holes of shadow cast by the net
of a grille balcony; cream linen, cream hat.
A spit like that worth any number of words.

I no longer believed in the revolution.
crystallize in The Twelve. Was between
I 

Sun-blazed, over Romsley, a livid rain-scarp. 

Some die shouting in gas or fire; 
Some die desperate, caught on the wire; 

Some die pinned by the broken decks, 

Some die eloquent, pressed to death 
Some die wholly in half a breath. 

"There is neither Evil nor Good in life. 
[Since it is rather too late for the knife, 

Some die broken by rape or the rope; 

"I will dash to pieces who bar my way. 
[Let him write what he wishes to say. 

Bad morale through the cots around . . . 

"The war was forced on me by my foes.

She cleaned house, and then lay down long
On the long stair.

On one of those cold white wings
That the strange fowl provide for us like one hillside of the sea,
That cautery of snow that blinds us,
Pitiless light,
One winter afternoon
Fair near the place where she sank down with one wing broken,
Three friends and I were caught
Stalk still in the light.

Five of the lights. Why should they care for our eyes?
Five deer stood there.
They looked back, a good minute.
They knew us, all right:
Four chemical accidents of horror pausing
Between one suicide or another
On the passing wing
Of an angel that cared no more for our biology, our pity, and our pain
Than we care.

Why should any mere multitude of the angels care
To lay one blind white plume down
On this outermost limit of something that is probably no more
Than an aphid,
An aphid which is one of the angels whose wings toss the black pears
Of tears down on the secret shores
Of the seas in the corner
Why should five deer
Gaze back at us?
They gazed back at us.
Afraid, and yet they stood there,
More alive than we four, in their terror,
In their good time.

We had a dog.
We could have got other dogs.
Two or three dogs could have taken turns running and dragging down
Those fleet lights, whose tails must look as mysterious as the
Stars in Los Angeles.
We are men.
To kill one another.
We are a smear of obscenity
On the lake whose only peace
Is a hole where the moon
Abandoned us, that poor

If I were the moon I would shrink into a sand grain

We are men.
We are capable of anything.
We could have killed every one of those deer.
The very moon of lovers tore herself with the agony of a wounded tigress
Out of our side.
We can kill anything.
We can kill our own bodies.
Those deer on the hillside have no idea what in hell
We are except murderers.
Corroding, as it is just born, in a pile of dead
Horse dung.
I have no use for the human creature.
He subtly extracts pain awake in his own kind.
I am born one, out of an accidental hump of chemistry.
I have no use.

But
Even though we know,
As well as you know,
We could have got away with it,
Because
Who cares?

Boissevain, who was he?
Was he human? I doubt it,
From what I know
Of men.

Who was he,
Hobbling with his dry eyes
Along in the rain?

I think he must have fallen down like the plumes of new snow,
I think he must have fallen into the grass, I think he
Must surely have grown around
Her wings, gathering and being gathered,
Leaf, string, anything she could use
To build her still home of songs
Within sound of water.

By God, come to that, I would have married her too,
Think of that. Being alive with a girl
Who could turn into a laurel tree
Whenever she felt like it.
Think of that.

Outside my window just now
I can hear a small waterfall rippling antiphonally down over
The stones of my poem.

By a dismal cypress lying,
Damon cried, all pale and dying,
Kind is death that ends my pain,
But cruel she I lov'd in vain.
The mossy fountains
Murmur my trouble,
And hollow mountains
My groans redouble:
Ev'ry nymph mourns me,
Thus while I languish;
She only scorns me,
Who caus'd my anguish.
No love returning me, but all hope denying;
By a dismal cypress lying,
Like a swan, so sung he dying:
Kind is death that ends my pain,
But cruel she I lov'd in vain.

A thousand martyrs I have made, 
A thousand beauties have betrayed, 
The untamed heart to hand I brought, 
And fixed the wild and wandering thought. 

I never vowed nor sighed in vain 
The fair are pleased to give us pain, 
And though I talked of wounds and smart, 

Alone the glory and the spoil 
The triumphs, without pain or toil, 
And while I thus at random rove 
Despise the fools that whine for love.

I
Along the Wilderness Road, through Cumberland Gap,
Across a buff clay belt with scrawls of stone,
Where bird and beast quailed in the bosom brush
Blue white, like sheer icicles, spired aglow
As if the three wise men barged in the East
Or priests in sackcloth balked the Scourge of God.
Foursquare by the rite of arm and heart and law,
The scrubby log cabin dared the compass points
The babel of the circumstance and era.
The frozen socket of its window stared
Beyond the spayed crabapple trees, to where
The skulls of hills, the skeletons of barrens,
Not knowing muck and star would vie for him,
The man Tom sank upon ax-split stool,
Hands fisted, feet set wide to brace the spirit,
Big shoulders shoved, dark hazel eyes glazed by
Grotesqueries of flame that yawled and danced
Up, up, the stick-clay chimney. While fire imps combed
The black and bristling hair, the acids of thoughts
Made of the orby face an etching-plate.
II
Near pyrotechnic logs, the purling kettle,
A granny at a childbed on the border,
Where head and backbone answered the tomahawk
Her wise old eyes had seen a hundred Nancys
In travail tread the dark winepress alone;
Her wise old hands had plucked a stubborn breed
Into the outer world of pitch and toss.
The cabin that her myth and mission entered
Became a castle in which Aunt Peggy throned
A dynasty of grunts and nods and glances.
The nest, the barn, the hovel had schooled her in
The ABC of motherhood, and somehow
She sensed so accurately a coming child
And now her keyhole look explored Tom Lincoln
Beneath the patched homespun, the hue and cry
Of malice, until she touched his loneliness,
The taproot that his fiber gave no tongue.
Then, lulling the wife, troubled in flesh and mind,
She eased the sack quilts higher and mused the while:
And seven times seventy ways of leaving it!
III
The woman Nancy, like a voyager sucked
Buoyed to the surface air of consciousness
And clutched the solace of her corn-husk bed.
Her dark face, sharped in forehead, cheekbone, chin,
Cuddled in dark brown hair; her eyes waxed grayer
With wonder of the interlude: her beauty
Out of the fog of pain, the bog of bygones,
The bag of cabin cant and tavern tattle,
She puzzled now, as then, about her father
Who let wild Lucy Hanks bundle and carry
Flesh of his flesh beyond the Cumberland Gap;
A strange roof is no roof when imps of fear
Pilfer the fatherless in blossom time.
Year in, year out, the daughter tinkered with
The riddle of her birth; the mother chided
The woman Nancy as she had the child,
The butt of bawd, grand jury, Sunday bonnet,
Lucy, driven, taught her daughter the Word,
And Nancy, driven, taught her son the Word,
And Abraham, driven, taught his people the Word!
IV
The man Tom bit his fingernails, then rammed
His pockets with the hector hands that gave
Raw timber the shape of cabinet and coffin,
He tapped the dirt floor with the iron-capped boot
That aided fist and skull in border fights.
Poor Joseph probably said in that low stable
She paused, then boxed the ears of cynicism:
Among the hogs, the chickens, the cows, the horses;
But, when it comes to Man, who knows, who knows
The man Tom turned and spat: his naked surmise
Conquered a land with gun and ax and plow,
How the elders wring it out is worry enough!
V
The clubfoot scholar bagged in Old World clothes,
With arrowy eyes and a hoary mushroom beard.
In spite of the hair-hung sword; his betters set
Him free to hail new truths in new lands, where
He seined with slave and master, knave and priest,
And out of all fished up the rights of man:
His full mug says a clear mind puts the question
Which ties the fogey scholar in a knot!
My new idea fed to his new baby
Would fetch the New World and the New Year peace!
The sum of anything unriddles the riddle:
The child whose wet nurse is the mother-of-all
Grows like a pine unmarked by rock or wind.
And Jesus begged the boon of little children!
VI
Aunt Peggy hovered closer, with flawless rites
Dragged from the bed of cleated poles; she hawed
Tom Lincoln, as one turns a nag aside,
Then swooped her way, even as a setting hen
Carves a dictatorship from yard to nest.
And Tom again was squeezed into a cell
Whose inmates were the ghosts of unsuccess.
Later his memories climbed a gala peak,
The bear meat, venison, wild turkey, duck,
The maple sugar hanging for the whiskey,
The red ham, gourds of syrup, bowls of honey,
The wood coal pit with brown and juicy sheep,
The guzzling, fiddling, guttling, monkeyshining:
A continent sprawled between that day and this!
A havenot on the frontier is no havenot;
A Crusoe without Friday has no conscience:
Of slavery, land titles, melancholy.
He, like his forebears, visioned a Promised Land
And tidied ways and means to fly the barrens
That doomed the flesh to peck, to patch, to pinch,
And wrung the soul of joy and beauty dry.
VII
The black ox hours limped by, and day crawled after.
White prongs of ice, like dinosaur fangs, gleamed in
The cavernous mouth of Rock Spring; snowbirds shivered
And chirped rebellion; a cow with jags and gaps
Chewed emptily; hogs squealed in hunger fits;
And scrags of dogs huddled against the chimney,
Which shoveled smoke dust into the throats and noses
Of ragged winds kicking up snow in the desert.
Nancy lay white, serene, like virgin milk
Beneath the sack quilts and the bearskin robe,
In yellow petticoat and linsey shirt,
An anonymity of soft red wrinkles.
Like ax and helve, like scythe and snath, the bond
Held Tom and Nancy; she smiled at his halt smile,

Each grief has its unique side.
Choose the one that appeals to you.
Go gently.
Your body needs energy to repair the amputation.
Humor phantom pain.

Your brain cells are soaked with salt;
connections fail unexpectedly and often.
Ask for help.
Accept help.

Read your grief like the daily newspaper:
headlines may have information you need.
Scream. Drop-kick the garbage can across the street.

Do things a little differently
Revel in contradiction.

Talk to the person who died.
Give her a piece of your mind.

Try to touch someone at least once a day.
Approach grief with determination.
Lean into the pain.
Fear me, virgin whosoever 
Taking pride from love exempt, 
Fear me, slighted. Never, never 
Brave me, nor my fury tempt: 
Downy wings, but wroth they beat 
Tempest even in reason's seat. 

The cold white light of morning, the blue moon 
Slowing down your body enough to feel.

Thought you were at a standstill
but you were only slowing down enough

to feel the pain. There are worse things

than running to catch the train, twisting 

Running to get to or away from?

the stranger who helps you up
wants to know, you who are so used to

anything scribbled on a prescription blank.

Just want the pain to go away, you say, 
surprised to find yourself

reaching for someone else's hand.

Awake, my St. John! leave all meaner things
To low ambition, and the pride of kings.
Let us (since life can little more supply
Than just to look about us and to die)
Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man;
A mighty maze! but not without a plan;
A wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot;
Or garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.
Together let us beat this ample field,
Try what the open, what the covert yield;
The latent tracts, the giddy heights explore
Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;
Eye Nature's walks, shoot folly as it flies,
And catch the manners living as they rise;
Laugh where we must, be candid where we can;
But vindicate the ways of God to man.

Long after the sun falls into the sea
and twilight slips off the horizon like a velvet sheet
and the air gets soaked in blackness;
long after clouds hover above like boulders
and stars crawl up and stud the sky;
long after bodies tangle, dance, and falter
and fatigue blows in and bends them
and sleep unloads its dreams and kneads them
and sleepers dive into the rivers inside them,
a girl unlatches a window,
walks shoeless into a forest,
her dark hair a flag rippling in darkness.

She walks into woods, her feet light-stepping
through puddles, over hard packed dirt,
through grassy hills, over sticks and pebbles
over sand soaked in day, stones sun-sizzled
over lakes and frigid streams
through dim cobbled streets
darkened squares and dusty pastures.
She runs from nothing, runs to nothing,
beyond pain, beyond graveyards and clearings.
In the dark the eyes of startled creatures
gleam like a herd of candles.
They scatter and give night its meaning.

What echo of a bell lulled her
what spirit, what scent of a word
whose storm wrote her
what banks fell to drown her
which blood star
which thread of water
which trickle of light
whose heart being launched
whose floating soul seduced her
what promise did it make her
whose memory burned her
whose prayer did she run to answer
whose help, what sorrow clot
what pain dammed inside her
what wall must she rebuild now
whose treasure beckons her
who spread ivy like a veil to blind her?
Daybreak lies chained to a blue wall
from which the stars drop
and lose all meaning.

She runs past villages that lost their names
roads that lost their destinations
seas that lost their compasses and sailors
rivers that lost their marshlands and travelers
houses that lost their sleepers and criers
trees that lost their songs and shadows
gardens that lost their violets and benches
valleys that lost their worms and farmers
mountains that lost their prophets and marauders
temples that lost their sinners and spires
lightning that lost its silver and wires
chimeras that lost their bridges
minotaurs that lost their fountains.
Crescent moons hover above her,
ancient white feathers, birdless, wingless
lost to their own meaning.

Music rises out of her vision.
It stands, a wall covered with silver mosses.
A clarinet sounds a wounded mare,
violins women who lost their children.
Flutes blow their hot dry breezes.
Pianos are mumbling sorcerers
calling spirits and powers.
Cellos chew on the sounds of thunder.
Dulcimers skip about on crutches.
Dance floors flash their knives
daring their dancers.
Words mill about the streets like orphans.
Then a lute begins groaning
and dawn loses its meaning.

Night girl, night girl
your book is full now.
You have drawn all the pictures.
You have seen many weepers.
Stars held your sky in place and moons
floated on your lakes and washed them.
When a bird sings
when dewed branches tilt sunlight into eyes
when curtains are soaked with light
when mirrors drown in shadows,
take your day to the shore, my child.
Put out the words that fired your waking,
scatter them on the sand like seeds,
then with your feet gently tap them,
and let the bright waves
receive your meaning.

my story is 
how deep the heart runs 
to hide & laugh  
with your hands 
over your blank mouth 
face behind the mask  
talking in tongues  
something tearing

that screams 
from the furnace  
the black candle

sweet pain of meat 

your story is 
a crippled animal 
dragging a steel trap 
across desert sand 
& its song of honey

a factory of blue jays 
in honey locust leaves 
wet pages of smoke 
like a man

Isaiah awoke angry.

Once God and Isaiah were friends.

God and Isaiah used to converse nightly, Isaiah would rush into the garden.

They conversed under the Branch, night streamed down.

Isaiah wanted a name for the pain, he called it sin.

Now Isaiah was a man who believed he was a nation.

Inside Isaiah God saw the worldsheet burning.

Isaiah and God saw things differently, I can only tell you their actions.

The nation stirred in its husk and slept again.

Like a hard glossy painting the nation slept.

Who can invent a new fear?

Yet I have invented sin, thought Isaiah, running his hand over the knobs.

God took the stay.

You, said Isaiah.

No answer.

Light bleached open the night camera.

God arrived.

Liar! said God.

Isaiah put his hands on his coat, he put his hand on his face.

Isaiah is a small man, said Isaiah, but no liar.

God paused.

Brittle on both sides, no lying.

He grinned in the dark, she went back inside.

Thank goodness we were able to wipe the Neanderthals out, beastly things,

Thus the butcher can display under our very eyes his hands on the block,
and never refer to the rooms hidden behind where dissections are effected,

where flesh is reduced to its shivering atoms and remade for our delectation
as cubes, cylinders, barely material puddles of admixtured horror and blood.

Myrmidon, Ottoman, Olmec, Huron, and Kush: gone, gone, and goodbye.

But back to the chamber of torture, to Rembrandt, who was telling us surely
that hoisted with such cables and hung from such hooks we too would reveal

within us intricate layerings of color and pain: alive the brush is with pain,
aglow with the cruelties of crimson, the cooled, oblivious ivory of our innards.

Fling out the hooves of your hands! Open your breast, pluck out like an Aztec
your heart howling its Cro-Magnon cries that compel to battles of riddance!

Our own planet at last, where purged of wilderness, homesickness, prowling,

who inhabits this palace, this senate, this sentried, barbed-wire enclosure
where dare enter none but subservient breeze; bent, broken blossom; dry rain.

O my dark Rosaleen, 
The priests are on the ocean green, 

Shall glad your heart, shall give you hope, 
Shall give you health, and help, and hope, 

The Erne, at its highest flood, 
For there was lightning in my blood, 

O, there was lightning in my blood, 

All day long, in unrest, 
The very soul within my breast 
The heart in my bosom faints 
My life of life, my saint of saints, 
To hear your sweet and sad complaints, 
My life, my love, my saint of saints, 
Woe and pain, pain and woe, 
To see your bright face clouded so, 
But yet will I rear your throne 

Over dews, over sands, 
Your holy delicate white hands 
At home, in your emerald bowers, 
My virgin flower, my flower of flowers, 

I could scale the blue air, 
Oh, I could kneel all night in prayer, 
And one beamy smile from you 
My toils and me, my own, my true, 
Would give me life and soul anew, 

O, the Erne shall run red, 

And gun-peal and slogan-cry 
Ere you shall fade, ere you shall die, 
The Judgement Hour must first be nigh, 
Ere you can fade, ere you can die,

 the artist and his age
 (though bald as the pilled head of garlic),
 married or divorced
 and even vying downstage,
 are both aware
 that God or Caesar is the handle
 (colorless as malic acid in a Black Hamburg grape),
 what profit it to argue at the wake
 with Auld Lang Syne
 to cheer the dead),
 if the artist wrought

 If brass,
 in the name
 of Id or Sinai or Helicon, wakes up the trumpet,
 is it to blame?
 Although

 this pain is only the ghost of the pain

 his far far cry,

 this bark of the Moreton Bay laurel),
 it is true
 a something trans-Brow or cis-Brow

 Yet, no lip need sneer to the beard of an ape of God,
 So, I say as the Sire

For this she starred her eyes with salt
And scooped her temples thin,
Until her face shone pure of fault
From the forehead to the chin.

In coldest crucibles of pain
Her shrinking flesh was fired
And smoothed into a finer grain
To make it more desired.

Pain left her lips more clear than glass;
It colored and cooled her hand.
She lay a field of scented grass
Yielded as pasture land.

For this her loveliness was curved
And carved as silver is:
For this she was brave: but she deserved
A better grave than this.

Have any of you, passers-by,
Had an old tooth that was an unceasing discomfort?
Or a pain in the side that never quite left you?
Or a malignant growth that grew with time?
So that even in profoundest slumber
There was shadowy consciousness or the phantom of thought
Of the tooth, the side, the growth?
Even so thwarted love, or defeated ambition,
Or a blunder in life which mixed your life
Hopelessly to the end,
Will like a tooth, or a pain in the side,
Float through your dreams in the final sleep
Till perfect freedom from the earth-sphere
Comes to you as one who wakes
Healed and glad in the morning!

I drove to Oak Park, took two tours,
And looked at some of the houses.
I took the long way back along the lake.
Seems basically a part of that tradition,
With the same admixture of expansion and restraint:
The space takes off, yet leaves behind a nagging
Feeling of confinement, with the disconcerting sense
That while the superficial conflicts got resolved,
The underlying tensions brought to equilibrium,
Imagine someone reading. Contemplate a man
Oblivious to his settings, and then a distant person
Standing in an ordinary room, hemmed in by limitations,
Yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life
That blooms within its own mysterious enclosure,
In a solitary space in which the soul can breathe
But by creating it, by giving it a self-sustaining
Atmosphere of depth, both in the architecture,
And in the unconstructed life that it contains.
In a late and very brief remark, Freud speculates
Which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself;
Which can turn a house into a refuge from despair.
I wish that time could bring the future back again
And let me see things as they used to seem to me
Alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow.
There used to be a logic in the way time passed
That made it flow directly towards an underlying space
Where all the minor, individual lives converged.
The moments borrowed their perceptions from the past
And bathed the future in a soft, familiar light
I remembered from home, and which has faded.
And the voices get supplanted by the rain,
The nights seem colder, and the angel in the mind
That used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky
Turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air,
While in its place a kind of monument appears,
Magnificent in isolation, compromised by proximity
As though the years had been a pretext for reflection,
As the faces that I cherished gradually withdraw,
The reassuring settings slowly melt away,
And what remains is just a sense of getting older.
In a variation of the parable, the pure of heart
Descend into a kingdom that they never wanted
And refused to see. The homely notions of the good,
The quaint ideas of perfection swept away like
Adolescent fictions as the real forms of life
Deteriorate with manically increasing speed,
The kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter,
But in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken,
Of losing everything, of acquiescing in the
Obvious approach (the house shaped like a box;
As the heart shrinks down to tiny, local things.
I met you more than thirty years ago, in 1958,
All moments weigh the same, and matter equally;
Yet those that time brings back create the fables
Of a happy or unsatisfying life, of minutes
Near the beginning of October, with the World Series
Playing quietly on the radio, and the windows open,
And the California sunlight filling up the room.
When I survey the mural stretched across the years
Parts of no importance to the whole design, but which,
In their obscurity, seem more permanent and real.
I see the desks and auditorium, suffused with
Yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that
Still remains there, in a space pervaded by a
Were amorphous, with nothing to hold on to,
And the past were there forever. And the art
Eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood,
Which harden into shapes as it recedes.
I wish I knew a way of looking at the world
Structure made of years and filled with images
I wish there were a place where I could stay
Where I could wander back and forth across a field
Replete with all the incidents and small details
That gave the days their textures, that bound the
Minutes into something solid, and that linked them
All together in a way that used to seem eternal.
Cadillac, which blew up late one summer evening
Climbing up the hill outside Del Mar. And later
Baby-butcher album at your house in Mission Bay;
And three years later listening to the Velvet
Underground performing in a roller skating rink.
And yet I often think of 1968 that way, as though
That single year contained the rhythms of the rest,
As what began in hope and eagerness concluded in
Intractable confusion, as the wedding turned into a
The parts were real, and yet the dense and living
Whole they once composed seems broken now, its
Voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me
More distantly each day, until the tangled years
Are finally drained of feeling, and collapse into a
House in Kensington, and mine above the canyon:
Then the flat by Sears in Cambridge, where we
Moved when we got married, and the third floor
Of the house on Francis Avenue, near Harvard Square;
The big apartment in Milwaukee where we lived the
Year that John was born, and last of all the
House in Whitefish Bay, where you live now
And all those years came inexplicably undone
In mid-July. The sequence ended late last year.
Suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world
As it exists for one. Then half of mine has ended,
While the fragment which has recently come to be
Contains no vantage point from which to see it whole.
I think that people are the sum of their illusions,
That the cares that make them difficult to see
Are eased by distance, with their errors blending
In an intricate harmony, their truths abiding
Yet each the same as all the others) and their
Disparate careers all joined together in a tangled
Moral vision whose intense, meandering design
Seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling,
As in grief, or in the pathos of a life
Cut off by loneliness, indifference or hate,
Not in the sense of private satisfactions, but of
Lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms
And with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real.
The whole transcends its tensions, like the intimate
Reflections on the day that came at evening, whose
Significance was usually overlooked, or misunderstood,
Because the facts were almost always unexceptional.
Two years ago we took our son to Paris. Last night
I picked him up and took him to a Lou Reed show,
And then took him home. I look at all the houses as I
Walk down Hackett Avenue to work. I teach my classes,
Visit friends, cook introspective meals for myself,
Is the perception of the world as something good
And held in common; as a place to be perfected
In the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters
That endowed it with integrity and structure,
And that merged its private moments with the past.
What broke it into pieces? What transformed the
Flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and
Or walking too far ahead of you on the rue Jacob?
I wish that life could be a window on the sun,
Instead of just this porch where I can stand and
Contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot
And feel it moving towards some unknown resolution.
The Guggenheim Museum just reopened. Tonight I
And how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky.
Merging with the scenery and embodying a milder,
More domestic notion of perfection, on a human scale
Confines of this bland, accommodating structure
Made of souvenirs and emblems, like the hammock
Hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished
Just a block or two away from where I live now?
I usually walk along the street on Sunday,
Musing on how beautiful it seems, how aspects of it
Recapitulate the Oak Park house and studio, with
Open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior,
A characteristic feature of his plans that made it
Difficult to find, although the hope was that in
In much the way that in the course of getting older,
And trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here,
I found myself pulled backwards through these old,
Uncertain passages, distracted by the details,
I lived a long time as both woman and girl it nearly killed me
Such as the oaks neither shake nor fidget in observation
And the objects worth discussing dissipate oh how they leak
Away from the creeds claiming one can get ahead of the pain
By naming see how the green will change you it really will
I went into the green with a vine across my back and from the mud
Came the pattern before the light could enter light turned
And denied us, the moss struggled toward the yellow
A fine pollen came up from the world and the road made this
Across patches of burned up grass untender and lines perpendicular
A body in a cloak upon a road rolling sweetly through the mind
Place this road in some distant future just like that foregone past
Get head of the pain the ages counsel, make plenty of money

Venus was said to turn into a virgin

so as to please her lovers. Perhaps,
overwhelmed by pain,
she eventually stopped bathing

the flowers by themselves are nothing:
only a refraction of color that,
in a week or two, will be thrown out.
Day by day, the water lowers. The red-

Morning and evening
Maids heard the goblins cry:
Come buy, come buy:
Apples and quinces,
Lemons and oranges,
Melons and raspberries,
Swart-headed mulberries,
Wild free-born cranberries,
Crab-apples, dewberries,
Pine-apples, blackberries,
All ripe together
Morns that pass by,
Fair eves that fly;
Come buy, come buy:
Our grapes fresh from the vine,
Pomegranates full and fine,
Dates and sharp bullaces,
Rare pears and greengages,
Damsons and bilberries,
Taste them and try:
Currants and gooseberries,
Bright-fire-like barberries,
Figs to fill your mouth,
Citrons from the South,
Sweet to tongue and sound to eye;

          Evening by evening
Among the brookside rushes,
Crouching close together
In the cooling weather,
With clasping arms and cautioning lips,
With tingling cheeks and finger tips.
Pricking up her golden head:
We must not buy their fruits:
Who knows upon what soil they fed
Hobbling down the glen.

Down the glen tramp little men.
One hauls a basket,
One bears a plate,
One lugs a golden dish
Of many pounds weight.
How fair the vine must grow
Whose grapes are so luscious;
How warm the wind must blow
Their offers should not charm us,
She thrust a dimpled finger
In each ear, shut eyes and ran:
Curious Laura chose to linger
Wondering at each merchant man.
One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.
She heard a voice like voice of doves
Cooing all together:
They sounded kind and full of loves
In the pleasant weather.

Like a rush-imbedded swan,
Like a lily from the beck,
Like a moonlit poplar branch,
Like a vessel at the launch
When its last restraint is gone.

          Backwards up the mossy glen
With their shrill repeated cry,
They stood stock still upon the moss,
Leering at each other,
Brother with queer brother;
Signalling each other,
Brother with sly brother.
One set his basket down,
One began to weave a crown
Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown
(Men sell not such in any town);
Of dish and fruit to offer her:
Laura stared but did not stir,
In tones as smooth as honey,
The rat-faced spoke a word
Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;
One parrot-voiced and jolly
One whistled like a bird.

          But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
To take were to purloin:
I have no copper in my purse,
I have no silver either,
And all my gold is on the furze
That shakes in windy weather
Sweeter than honey from the rock,
Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,
She never tasted such before,
How should it cloy with length of use?
Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
Then flung the emptied rinds away
And knew not was it night or day

          Lizzie met her at the gate
Full of wise upbraidings:
Twilight is not good for maidens;
Should not loiter in the glen
In the haunts of goblin men.
Do you not remember Jeanie,
How she met them in the moonlight,
Took their gifts both choice and many,
Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
Where summer ripens at all hours?
But ever in the noonlight
She pined and pined away;
Sought them by night and day,
Found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;
Then fell with the first snow,
While to this day no grass will grow
Where she lies low:
I planted daisies there a year ago
That never blow.
I ate and ate my fill,
Yet my mouth waters still;
To-morrow night I will
Fresh on their mother twigs,
Cherries worth getting;
You cannot think what figs
My teeth have met in,
What melons icy-cold
Piled on a dish of gold
Too huge for me to hold,
What peaches with a velvet nap,
Pellucid grapes without one seed:
Odorous indeed must be the mead
Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink
With lilies at the brink,

          Golden head by golden head,
Like two pigeons in one nest
Like two blossoms on one stem,
Like two wands of ivory
Wind sang to them lullaby,
Lumbering owls forbore to fly,

staring from the end of the world

Child of my winter, born 
When the new fallen soldiers froze 
When I was torn 

By love I could not still, 
By fear that silenced my cramped mind 
My peace in my will, 

All those days we could keep 
Your mind a landscape of new snow 
His fields asleep 

In their smooth covering, white 
As quilts to warm the resting bed 
For me to write, 

And thinks: Here lies my land 
Unmarked by agony, the lean foot 
And I have planned 

My chances to restrain 
It snows again.

Comes to a puddle, lifts his feet 
Recoil to swing him through the weather, 

We read of cold war soldiers that 
Pain seeps up from some cavity 

For good, they sever and divide 

And nobody seems very pleased. 

It may help that a Chinese play 
Or Solomon himself might say

Spring is the cold wind's aftermath. 

petunias and dwarf marigold,

You are already growing 
Strange to me. 

Hey ding-a-ding-a-ding 
Or where I go 

Or when I sang for bedtime, Fox 
Went out on a chilly night, 
Before I went for walks 
And did not write; 

That are renewed long since; 
Outside the thick snow swarms 
Into my prints 

Dark cowbarns, huddled, still, 
Beyond to the blank field, 

Gnawed off, he cannot feel; 
Conceded to the jaw 
Of toothed, blue steel.

One Christmastime Fats Waller in a fur coat 
Each at an arm as he led them in a thick downy snowfall 

Across Thirty-Fourth Street into the busy crowd 
Chimes rang for change. In Toys, where my mother worked 

Over her school vacation, the crowd swelled and stood 
Filling the aisles, whispered at the fringes, listening 
To the sounds of the large, gorgeously dressed man, 

His smile bemused and exalted, lips boom-booming a bold 
Bass line as he improvised on an expensive, tinkly 

She put into my heart this scene from the romance of Joy, 
My father making the winning basket at the buzzer 

The brilliant black and white of the movies, texture 

Reflections that slid over the thick brass baton 
That worked the elevator. Happiness needs a setting: 
Shepherds and shepherdesses in the grass, kids in a store, 

And paper streamers twisted in two colors: what I felt 
Dancing close one afternoon with a thin blonde girl 

Was my amazing good luck, the pleased erection 
Stretching and stretching at the idea She likes me, 
She likes it, the thought of legs under a woolen skirt, 

Into the street we saw it had begun, the firm flakes 
Sticking, coating the tops of cars, melting on the wet 
Black street that reflected storelights, soft 

Separate crystals clinging intact on the nap of collar 
And cuff, swarms of them stalling in the wind to plunge 
Sideways and cluster in spangles on our hair and lashes, 

Melting to a fresh glaze on the bloodwarm porcelain 
Of our faces, Hey nonny-nonny boom-boom, the cold graceful 
Manna, heartfelt, falling and gathering copious 

As the air itself in the small-town main street 

II 

My unconceived heart in a way waiting somewhere like 
Wherever it goes in sleep. Later, my eyes opened 

And I woke up glad to feel the sunlight warm 
High up in the window, a brighter blue striping 
Blue folds of curtain, and glad to hear the house 

To balance my chest on the top rail, cheek 

With sets of double tooth-lines. Clinging 
With both arms, I grunted, pulled one leg over 
And stretched it as my weight started to slip down 

With some panic till my toes found the bottom rail, 
Thrilled, half-scared, still hanging high up 

With both hands from the spindles. Then lower 
Slipping down until I could fall to the floor 
With a thud but not hurt, and out, free in the house. 

Then softly down the hall to the other bedroom 
To push against the door; and when it came open 
More light came in, opening out like a fan 

So they woke up and laughed, as she lifted me 
Up in between them under the dark red blanket, 
We all three laughing there because I climbed out myself. 

Earlier still, she held me curled in close 
With everyone around saying my name, and hovering, 

As he held me up for the camera, and the pain buzzed 
Scaring me because it twisted right inside me; 
So when she took me and held me and I curled up, sucking, 

It was as if she had put me back together again 
So sweetly I was glad the hurt had torn me. 
She wanted to have made the whole world up, 

A letter I wrote my sister, who was having trouble 
Getting on with her, and read some things about herself 

That made her go to the telephone and call me up: 

Or having followed pain inside she owned her children 
From the inside out, or made us when she named us, 

III 

Made me Robert. She took me with her to a print-shop 
Where the man struck a slug: a five-inch strip of lead 
With the twelve letters of my name, reversed, 

Raised along one edge, that for her sake he made 
For me, so I could take it home with me to keep 
And hold the letters up close to a mirror 

Or press their shapes into clay, or inked from a pad 
Onto all kinds of paper surfaces, onto walls and shirts, 

The little characters fading from my arm, the gift 
Always ready to be used again. Gifts from the heart: 
Her giving me her breast milk or my name, Waller 

Showing off in a store, for free, giving them 
A thrill as someone might give someone an erection, 

Eighteen shucked fresh oysters and the cold bottle 
Sweating in its ribbon, surprise, happy birthday! 
So what if the giver also takes, is after something? 

So what if with guile she strove to color 
A scarf or bit of sleeve of her favorite color 

Or sudden jazz for becoming what we want? I want 

The generator flashlight Italo gave me one Christmas: 
One squeeze and the gears visibly churning in the amber 

Pistol-shaped handle hummed for half a minute 
In my palm, the spare bulb in its chamber under my thumb, 
Secret; or, the knife and basswood Ellen gave me to whittle. 

And until the gift of desire, the heart is a titular, 
Insane king who stares emptily at his counselors 
For weeks, drools or babbles a little, as word spreads 

In the taverns that he is dead, or an impostor. One day 
A light concentrates in his eyes, he scowls, alert, and points 

Generals and courtiers groan, falling to work 
With a frantic movement of farriers, cooks, builders, 
The city thrown willing or unwilling like seed 

(While the brain at the same time may be settling 
Into the morning Chronicle, humming to itself, 

IV 

Toward war, new forms of worship or migration. 
Of the little two-family house, and into the Woods: 

Guns, chevrons, swordplay, a scarf of sooty smoke 
Rolled upwards from a little cratewood fire 
Under the low tent of a Winesap fallen 

With fingers rooting in the dirt, the old orchard 
Smothered among the brush of wild cherry, sumac, 
Sassafras and the stifling shade of oak 

In the strip of overgrown terrain running 
East from the train tracks to the ocean, woods 
Of demarcation, where boys went like newly-converted 

Christian kings with angels on helmet and breastplate, 
Bent on blood or poaching. There are a mountain and a woods 

Of four stayed half-aware it was past dark 
In a crude hut roasting meat stolen from the A&P 

And scared us home to catch hell: We were worried, 
Where have you been? In the Woods. With snakes and tramps. 
An actual hobo knocked at our back door 

One morning, declining food, to get hot water. 
He shaved on our steps from an enamel basin with brush 
And cut-throat razor, the gray hair on his chest 

And the otherlife of snakes, poison oak, boxcars. 
Were the trees cleared first for the trains or the orchard? 

Walking home by the street because it was dark, 
That night, the smoke-smell in my clothes was like a bearskin. 
Where the lone hunter and late bird have seen us 

Pass and repass, the mountain and the woods seem 
In a song or poem seemed cloaked laments 

For the woods when Indians made lodges from the skin 
Of birch or deer. When the mysterious lighted room 
Of a bus glided past in the mist, the faces 

Passing me in the yellow light inside 
Were a half-heard story or a song. And my heart 
Moved, restless and empty as a scrap of something 

Blowing in wide spirals on the wind carrying 
The sound of breakers clearly to me through the pass 
Between the blocks of houses. The horn of Roland 

V 

But what was it I was too young for? On moonless 
Nights, water and sand are one shade of black, 
And the creamy foam rising with moaning noises 

Charges like a spectral army in a poem toward the bluffs 
Before it subsides dreamily to gather again. 
I thought of going down there to watch it a while, 

Feeling as though it could turn me into fog, 
Or that the wind would start to speak a language 

Burning in some certain misted window I passed, 
A house or store or tap-room where the strangers inside 
Would recognize me, locus of a new life like a woods 

Or orchard that waxed and vanished into cloud 
Like the moon, under a spell. Shrill flutes, 
Oboes and cymbals of doom. My poor mother fell, 

And after the accident loud noises and bright lights 
Hurt her. And heights. She went down stairs backwards, 

Over the years, she got better. But I was lost in music; 
The cold brazen bow of the saxophone, its weight 
At thumb, neck and lip, came to a bloodwarm life 

Jacket and pants with a satin stripe I aspired 
To the roughneck elegance of my Grandfather Dave. 

Sometimes, playing in a bar or at a high school dance, I felt 
My heart following after a capacious form, 

Thrum, come-wallow and then a little screen 
Of quicker notes goosing to a fifth higher, winging 
To clang-whomp of a major seventh: listen to me 

Listen to me, the heart says in reprise until sometimes 
In the course of giving itself it flows out of itself 
All the way across the air, in a music piercing 

As the kids at the beach calling from the water Look, 
Look at me, to their mothers, but out of itself, into 
The listener the way feeling pretty or full of erotic revery 

Makes the one who feels seem beautiful to the beholder 

Yearning further into giving itself into the air, breath 
Strained into song emptying the golden bell it comes from, 
The pure source poured altogether out and away.

And in the house of fact, when you take off your shirt,

are how you make the right side talk to the left.

can see it breaking into fits of weeping.
Now that even our eyes have their dedicated poverties,

now that even our eyes are chained to their slavish occupations,
whatever the soul lacks drains the soul to nothing.
I hate to admit it, but even the house of fact is a house of ruin.

2. rest

The strange is done with, over,
the strange that late at night you returned
to chat with again and again. No longer will anyone
wait for me in my corner where

good is bad, where that tight-lipped morning
of tears by the bay means nothing anymore
to anyone. To be cleared of the inks that stain
my ankles while watching my eyes go blind in the mirror

is the kind of rest that the seventh day promises
but never brings. Instead, the species
climbs aboard the ark of copulation

and ignores the forty days and nights of rain.
And the much-talked-of soul that the rain denies
burrows deep into the mud of so much pain.

3. spider

Look at the spider with the enormous body and tiny head,
a spider of no color: today, when I kneel
down to look at it more closely, its many arms nailed
to a many-armed cross are a prayer in a code that only God,

invisible to my eyes, which guided it like a pilot
through the wilderness of space,
no longer steer its legs across the intricate,

almost-not-thereness of its web. Each thread
it spins with the finality of fate divides its head
from its body. And the poor thing,

Just look at its abdomen, huge as the stone blocking

inside every healing wound, witness how your
own inner grace, gnawing at itself, gets baptized

in phosphates of hemlock and error.
And so what if the sunset arrives from Athens?
So what if no trace of anyone survives?

5. the last to be excused

Remember the old aunts, sarcastic,
chain-smoking, gesturing with their canes,
scoring point after point with their widowed lungs?

How was I to eat with them as they pushed
around their plates not peas and carrots
but distance and disdain for their silly nephew

still trying, at his age, to forget
how being old is as new to the old

even their glued-together, half-cracked
china radiates impatience for the pity
that the young want them to want.

they handled their knives, forks, spoons,
making each bite harder to swallow.

The table will be set with shadows,

will sit down on chairs of dust

or the food from the plate, or the plate

omg, it makes me cry to admit that I am human;

Oh sure, you claimed you raised me from the dust,

You know nothing of those Marias who split for good.

But in your always everywhere hard partying with perfection

you feel nothing of the pain of your creation.

Today, in my middle-aged pupils, I see the glare of candles
lit for my death-row vigil. omg, old gambler, take up

in the fated luck you dole out to the universe

omg, in this night gone deaf and blind,

is just a single die whose edges have grown rounded
by rolling too many eons through the battering sky

and nobody now can stop it until it rolls into a hole,
the vast hole, omg, inside a single molecule.

7. the other garden

In the Garden there was a spider.
And because the man knelt beside him, the spider
overheard him, the agony of his prayer

any other direction than into the web stretching out
no matter which way the fly veers. The spider
felt the threads of all being vibrate

to the prayer of the man praying to his father
to let this cup pass. But on the cross, when the man cried out
to his father not to abandon him, his father

did abandon him. And so the spider
vowed to weave a web so tightly around the father that the harder

If it rains tonight, will a raindrop be my cell?
Will the bars the sky lets down
take one look at me and turn to steel?
Now that the hot afternoon is finally done,

done the cups of tea we drank with your mother,
I want to ask the rain to yank my strings
back a thousand years. But even back that far,
will the rain still be my prison?

To be lost in the minutiae
of our vacations from the soul, to forget
the Vedic threads spun out beyond my end,

to press against your breasts obedient
to the purest pulses. Yeah, sure. Make the story
of my life the story of my never having been.
How long do you want to go on being the person you think you are?
How Long, a city in China

The nouns come toward you
"Knee how," they say
To the cluster of synonyms also approaching
How long, how long, baby, how long?
Let me know
if you ever change your mind
about leaving, leaving me behind
or at least tell yourself
before you find yourself on that train
winding its way through the mountains of How Much Province

The ten thousand yellow leaves of the ginkgo tree
kerplumfed onto the sidewalk on East 12th Street,
a deep-pile carpet of them on the roof of the parked car
proving that Nature does have a sense of humor,
though if a sense of humor falls in the woods
and there is no one there to hear it. . . .

for everyone has clustered alongside the railroad track
for the arrival of night and its shooting stars with trails like pigtails
I am among them and I know this track is mine
though it does not belong to me

Nothing belongs to me

for at this moment the boxes are being stacked
to make way for you to move through them,
reading their labels: family photos, Pick-Up Stix, miscellaneous
and the song of the porcelain, the celadon, and Delft itself
vibrating How long, how long
will this baby take to depart?

But I don't want to think about the past
I want to be the past,
with everything I've ever known and done
spread out on a two-dimensional plane
erected vertically and moving through the space I occupy on Earth

There is a lot more room left in me
though everyone I've ever known who's died is there
My mother my father say hello
to Ted and Joe and laugh with them
though Joe knows they are crying too
and that Ted is crying
and it sounds like laughter

They do this to console me
and I let them do it, to console them

What? I didn't hear you
or rather I heard you
but I couldn't make out what you said

The phone lay in its cradle
pretending to be asleep
and the blinking light made you think
that it was dreaming and that
or were they supposed to call you?

Supposed. What does that mean.
It means no more than the contours of the landscape
that is as beautiful as the contours in John Ashbery's poetry
but it doesn't mean anything
unless you turn your mind on its side
and let it lie there
inert, and from this inertia
will arise a wing, the white wing
of a bird that has no anything else,
only this one wing
that folds and unfolds itself
like the magnetic field it rises above
in wave after wave after wave.

Then it's back to basics:
If you bone or debone a chicken
it comes out the same,
if you dust a cake with sugar
you add something
but if you dust your house you take away.
Oh to be a rock or a stone or even a pebble!
Momentarily,
for there is much that is unattractive about being a rock.
For one thing, I wouldn't be able
to finish this poem, I would sit here petrified
until they carted me away
to a park to serve as ornamental sculpture,
if I were lucky.

Now that you are convinced of something
that you already believed, the wallpaper becomes a fact
in the home of Anne and Fairfield Porter,
in the upstairs hallway and the bedroom
where Jimmy stayed, the wallpaper that here and there
was curling off the wall so Joe could tear it off
and glue it to a big white sheet of paper.
There is no other wallpaper
I would ever want.
Now the wallpaper goes away,
back on the wall in 1969
where I stood and gazed at it for a long time
and then went downstairs
to add coal to Fairfield's stove,
the big Aga he had shipped all the way from Sweden
because he was very determined to have it.
All day its warmth rose up to the second floor
and caressed the wallpaper.
Do you mind my going on like this?
You want something else, right?
Perhaps you want what you think poetry should give you,
but poetry doesn't give anyone anything,
it simply puts the syllables on the table
and lets you rearrange them in your head,
which you can do unless your head is a square
the size of the tabletop.
So why don't you lift your head off the table
and go lie down somewhere
more comfortable
and not worry about anything,
including the list of things to worry about
that you keep revising in your head,
for there is a slot through which that list
can slip and float down like a baby in a rocking crib,
down to a comfy dreamland
and be transformed into a list of gods whose jokes are wonderful.
But when the alarm goes off
the jokes don't seem funny
but what? (You weren't even asleep.)
It's not something you feel you're going to remember,
it's not as if you can go down the alphabet
until you get to a letter that has a special hum
because it's the first letter of the name
you can't quite recall,
it's not as if you can look just to the side of where
you think a dim star is and thereby have it magically appear.
The glow is gone,
and knowing it comes back sometimes
is little consolation.
But I'll take it
and go not to a deserted island
but to the factory where they make the bottles
that are washed ashore with a message inside,
and though the message has been blurred by water stains
that poetry is something written by someone other than the poet
to someone other than the reader.
though in some of your works no chapeau,
for in them it is not a bottle but a test tube
one finds one's finger stuck in.

What do you want to do with your life?
is a question asked of a young person
but slightly modified for an older one:
What do you want to do with the rest of your life?
Having control is an illusion we like to be fooled by:
the pinball machine of experience has bounced us
off one thing and onto another bing bing bing!
Life might be like a pinball machine
but it isn't one, and the trouble is
that you might be like a person
and you are one, as if in reverie,
but then it all seems crambe.

And so Sir Thomas Browne walks in
with an insane look on his face, he is searching
for examples of the number 5, do you
have any new ones for him? If not
please step aside, and out he goes
into the garden, eyes locked
onto the vegetation, the afternoon light
on the back of his coat.

You're relieved he didn't stay long.

For God's sake
here he comes again.
Lock the door!
But he performs osmosis
and becomes the door and then
the room and then you!
And you go about the house
looking for examples of the number 5
and you don't know why or where
it will all lead to.

But I do.
Who said that?
I did.
Why did you say that?
I didn't.

I could not pity your pain but I pitied the branches
Losing what little the frost had left them to hold.
I could not warm you with sorrow; I turned to the sparrows,
Clustered like heavy brown blossoms puffed out by the cold.

They could not help me. I looked at my hands; they were helpless;
Strange and detached, less related to me than the birds.
Baffled, I called on the mind: it carried me, floundering,
Lost among meaningless phrases, tossed in a welter of words.

Too great for my blundering comfort, your anguish confused me.
From a great distance, I saw you standing alone.
Frozen and stark, in a black iron circle of silence,
I could not pity your pain; I could scarcely pity my own.

I
Strange now to think of you, gone without corsets & eyes, while I walk on the sunny pavement of Greenwich Village.
looking back on the mind itself that saw an American city
No more to say, and nothing to weep for but the Beings in the Dream, trapped in its disappearance,
sighing, screaming with it, buying and selling pieces of phantom, worshipping each other,
thru Paterson, and the West, and Europe and here again,
with the cries of Spaniards now in the doorstoops doors and dark boys on the street, fire escapes old as you
No more flowers in the summer fields of New York, no joy now, no more fear of Louis,
Is it only the sun that shines once for the mind, only the flash of existence, than none ever was?
You once kicked Elanor in the leg, she died of heart failure later. You of stroke. Asleep? within a year, the two of you, sisters in death. Is Elanor happy?

II

Your dying was a difficult enterprise.
First, petty things took up your energies,
Already with a kind of clumsy stealth
Distanced you from the habits of your health.
Without import. But then the spinal tap.
Every half-hour with the same short cry
Of mild outrage, before immediately
Slipping into the nightmare once again
Empty of content but the drip of pain.
The hedonistic body basks within
In a dry mouth. You had gone on from me
A gust of morphine hid you. Back in sight
Jammed down your throat so that you could not speak.
State for what holds and rests were hidden in it.
Thick with the complicating circumstance
We talked between our sleeping bags, below
A molten field of stars five years ago:
Though I was tired and begged you to leave off.

Now you were tired, and yet not tired enough
Feeling as uncompleted as a child
Rueful, at your own silliness.
Long-term, precisely, when they gave the shot
And pulled a pillow round beside your head.
Achieving your completeness, in a way.

Of being ejected with some violence
Where I was numb, into this garden plot
I was delivered into time again
And must have loved its fickleness a bit
Took over by betraying it into
The greatest of its inconsistencies
This difficult, tedious, painful enterprise.

The unsigned architecture of loneliness
is becoming taller, finding a way farther
above the horizontal flowering
of the Cold War, the peonies
and star asters of wild partisanship.
I have a shambling gait and lonely
hysteria, but no Terror. I am free
conception, to shamble past the bar where I
conceived adultery as a Terror
that would be endless, flowering
in great waves through air striated like chenille.
I walk for a long time and try to conjure
elsewhere in its early isolation.
I cannot. It is all redestinated
by the future like the loose balloons
a janitor recovers at 6 am
from cold light fixtures. The Cold War is ending.
Buildings are taller and have no names.

1.
The romance of every ideology
torments the romance of another. How
beautifully, in the beginning, in
the gale and embrace of isolation, boys
capered over a shambles and swore oaths.
The scent of urine in the hall at home
was righteousness. The beautiful nude
obscured by dust in a paperweight
was righteousness. Neglectful townships coming
into steep flower just as boys were flowering
the horizontal slag of government
by children. Only the insane allegiances
endure. The mad counterparts are lovers
passion cannot explain nor circumstances
restrict to the dead zones of irony.
A counterpart of end of the Cold War
is adultery. A counterpart
of loving a divided Berlin
unto death is fatherhood, the doting
maintenance of sons in vacant lots
continuing the wars of rubble
of nudes obscured by dust and vulgarity.

Romance torments romance. The most beautiful
moment of the twentieth century
galed and embraced the acrid smoky air
as the Red Army entered Berlin
as Hitler shriveled in the gasoline fire
as Red Army flags opened above Berlin
safeguarding the ruins of a changeless future.
Townships blackened even as they flowered.
Loose balloons cluttered the low sky and sun.
I walked for a long time and tried to conjure
the form of kindness. It was a domestic
animal confused in the tall grass.
Boys set fire to the grass. History
that opens flags opened the fire,
and Berlin, divided from Berlin,
began to love its children past all reason.

2.
My son reads sermons of pain and writes on walls.
He starves the ground
he walks on, preparing a dead city
to be worthy of its new flags, to shine
as exploded windows shine, raining down
for hours after the wrecking crews have gone.
I have a lover now who hates children.
The hatred floats inside of her, a weightless
and perfect emptiness. I thought
by making love to her I would conceive
nothing but Terror, outrage upon outrage,
a violence that would last my whole life
and free my son. I was ignorant as a balloon.

Across the luminous expressway, I see
the shapes of charred tenements castellated,
fading into the more tender shapes of night.
It may be the last night in history. Tomorrow
pulls down the Berlin Wall, pulls down my honor,
Tomorrow describes everything in detail.
It explains nothing. It does not teach my boy
that tenements are better than the future,
better that peace, more likely to produce
brothers than are the glassy hands of mornings
without end or walls denuded of their wire.
In the dead zone of irony before dawn,
only the cats cry, like martyrs in the flame.

3.
Gates everywhere. The Brandenburg. The Great
Gate of Kiev beneath which children stride
onto an invisible crescendo
disappearing into gasoline fires,
emerging as the new shapes of righteousness
in slow vans through the Brandenburg Gate.
Oaths are secret because none suspects
that they are kept. They thrust themselves towards us
unashamedly, like the insane homeless,
and we do not see them. In our loneliness,
we see a chance for love in betrayal,
not death. In our loneliness, we see the happy
triumph of glassy hands in free elections,
not the denuding of Berlin or wanderings
of children in vans reduced by fire
to black transparencies in the morning shade.
When Joan of Arc surrendered to the flames
a failed magician who had lover her cried out
too easy to be unreal or profitable.

I walk for a long time and try to conjure
the form of loneliness without Cold War.
It is ash upon ash, a chiaroscuro
aloft and on the ground, completely still.
Oaths are secret because none suspects
the desperation of every object, the child
in every atom of the misused world
thrust towards us, crying out whatever
sacred name it witnessed put to death
on the ascending music of a wall.
Our buildings are tall and have no names.
The parks grow glassy hands instead of flowers.

4.
Afterwards, the calm is piteous
but insubstantial as a smell of burn
that does not rise in smoke or dies with the fire.
Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise
and having to invent air, invent light
from nothing but untriggered memory.
All things beloved are recalled to pain.
Air recollected from the wrists of girls
braceleted for Confirmation, crossed.
Light recollected from between the cars
of night trains in a deep river valley
where islands in the river glowed like swans.
Air recollected form a ditch in flower.
in bare rooms, the grainy light of blondes.
Air recollected from religion.
Light recollected form the incensed clutch
of bodies before sunrise in the oaths
of a great and ignorant lost cause.

Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise
having spent the night in bed with a stranger.
Aloft and on the ground the calm
unfurls like flags without device or slogan.
The inconsequence of the day ahead
stirs airless atmospheres in darkness
visible as daylight but without shade.
Without Cold War, without the arbitrary
demarcation of cause from cause, of light
of memory, I cannot see to walk
avant garde of lonely architecture
breaks ground at the unwired heart of a city
that marks the capital of nothing now.

5.
A scratchy, recorded call to prayer crosses
the alley from one new building into mine.
The consolations of history are furtive,
then fugitive, then forgotten like a bar
of music that might have been obscene or sacred
once, in another city, in the days
before today. My son is well. He works
the public ground and needs no Antigone.
My lover sits beside him at dinner,
sharing a joke, unmapping the tall future
and its unbiased children, reinventing
plague wards. Romance forgives romance.

The early isolation of this gorgeous
century disappears into good works.
The future is best. To put a final stop
to the grotesque unmercy of martyrdom
and to the ruinous armies of mad boys
whose government is rape, whose justice
is a wall, revoke all partisanship,
adjourn the Terror. The future is best.
It unobscures the dusty nudes. It protects
the river islands and their glowing swans.
But when I need to die, who will light the fire?
What names shall I cry out and what music
burn to a black transparency in my heart?
The unborn have been revoked. They will not be kind.

Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 't is early morn:
Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle-horn.

'T is the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call,
Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;

Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,
And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.

Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,
Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.

Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade,
Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.

Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime
With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;

When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;
When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:

When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;

In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;
In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;

In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;
In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.

Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,
And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.

And I said, "My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,
Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee."

On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,
As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.

One evening at a party; a man I liked enormously
Preferred Athens; Greece seems to me a country
The whole mind of night that I know so well
Of falls ... No, it was that this dark was the deep, sensual dark
Spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of
The white buds lost in those fields of ever-deepening gentians,
Above me, the inverted reflection of a last,

The spread ripples of the opiate night ... And Nico
And deep within the pupil of her left eye,
I could see, at the most remote end of the receding,
At the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil,
Silver, lit by the ragged shards of starlight, reflecting
Some years later, I saw Nico on stage in New York, singing
Obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple, deadly
Fanning her pale, chalky hair out along its currents,
The sad, lucent malevolence of the heavens, falling ...
Then forever ...

The fellow talking to himself is me,
Though I don't know it. That's to say, I see
Him every morning shave and comb his hair
And then lose track of him until he starts to care,
In front of his computer, in a battered leather chair
That needs to be thrown out . . . then I lose track
Until he strides along the sidewalk on the attack
This guy is, glaring at strangers in the street!
Completely crazy but not at all insane.
He's hot but there's frostbite in his brain.
He's hot but freezing cold, and oh so cool.
He's been called a marvelously elegant ghoul.
But with a torn rotator cuff, even an elegant fawn
Has to go through shoulder seizures to get his jacket on.
He manages spastically. His left shoulder's gone.
It means, in pain, he's drastically awake at dawn.
A friend of his with pancreatic cancer, who will die,
Is not in pain so far, and she will try
To palliate her death, is what her life is now.
The fellow's thinking to himself, Yes but how?
Riding a motorcycle very fast is one way to.
The moon and stars rapidly enter you
While you excrete the sun. You ride across the earth
Looking for a place to lay the eggs of your rebirth.
The eggs crack open and out comes everyone.
The chicks chirp, and it's begun, and it's fun.
You keep on writing till you write yourself away,
The eggs crack open and out comes everyone.
Speaking of someone else for a change, not me,
There was that time in Stockholm when, so strangely,
Outside a restaurant, in blinding daylight, a tiny bird
Circled forever around us and then without a word
Lightly, lightly landed on my head and settled there
And you burst into tears. I was unaware
That ten years before the same thing had happened just
After your young daughter died and now it must
Have been Maria come back from the dead a second time to speak
And receive the recognition we all seek.

Give me more love or more disdain;
      The torrid, or the frozen zone,
Bring equal ease unto my pain;
      The temperate affords me none;
Either extreme, of love, or hate,
Is sweeter than a calm estate.

Give me a storm; if it be love,
      Like Danae in that golden show'r
I swim in pleasure; if it prove
      Disdain, that torrent will devour
My vulture-hopes; and he's possess'd
Of heaven, that's but from hell releas'd.

Then crown my joys, or cure my pain;
Give me more love, or more disdain.

The question is not how like the animals we are
But how we got that way. We laugh, for what is a suicide note
But the epitaph of an emotion? Few of us die out in the open;
And when you say thesis, I say antithesis,
Plant them on opposing cliffs and then build a footbridge
Between them, seemingly flimsy yet sturdy enough in fact
To support a battalion. Hidden behind trees, we watch
The soldiers march across it, single file, too scared
To look down. We cheer them all, all except the boy
In the fairy tale who knew no fear. Him we pity.
He laughs open-eyed, ready to die as we were not.
He is one of us, all right, but better, stronger, stranger.
He asks for more fear than anyone can bear.
II.
The guilty had three choices: awkward chords of candor,
Silence returned triumphant, and the journey resumed
In darkness, though the sky above was classically blue.
Everyone kept his opinion to himself
As harmony dictated, and effigies of Tristan and Isolde
Accompanied their stubborn footsteps across the wild
Terrain. Yet the longing for a loud catharsis
Out of these clouds and heartfelt headaches,
Like ravished children in the glory of a snowball fight
After school, and never again have to descend,
Who would not abandon these erotic shipwrecks
III.
At a festival of conceptual art in Cairo,
I saw a tank buried entirely in snow.
I knew then that silence is the source
Of all music, all laughter, all thought, and so
I stuffed pebbles in my mouth and stood by the sea
And roared my defiance of the waves. It was here,
Years before, that our plane and its shadow
Converged: I ran from the fire, carrying the flames
In my arms. I ran and ran, feeling like a man
A beach at all: the sand beneath me was snow,
Is snow, and the spears in the desert sky look like stars.
Who heard the crimson explosion, and ran. And ran.
IV.
This place looks a lot like an empty railway station,
A place whose smoke and fog Monet dissolved
Into a chorus of colors. There we stood, my love and I,
Having made our vows under the suspended clock,
Hero and bride. But as we walked away, side by side,
Of the crowd, and foreign languages spoken loud,
We knew our exile had already begun, could hear
At the end of the tunnel, where the battlefields begin.
V.
Paradise was hardly what Psyche
With her bleeding blackberries and nervous orgasms
Could have foretold, enjoyed,
And renounced for the sake of some querulous abstraction
Designed to keep us unhappy but alive.
Call it civilization. Call our disobedience instinctive.
Or say we obeyed an angry muse, who ordered us to dance.
You face your former self, and grieve over incidents
Scarcely recalled, and eat without pleasure, and drink
In the revelation of our nakedness, we danced.
VI.
We feel free. In the other room the true believers remain,
The ones who insist that evil is real, the only real thing.
Cannibals and missionaries they are, accomplices in sin,
Greedy for punishment, to inflict or endure it.
We are glad to leave them behind, glad not to have to hear
Their chants and wails. Down the elevator we go
And out into the canyon created by skyscraper shadows.
Yet even we, dedicated as we are to good living,
Sometimes walk around with a lost look on our faces,
As if the blessing for a piece of fruit or cup of wine
Had suddenly come to mind, though cup and plate are empty;
Had come to mind and faded almost instantly away.
VII.
Admit it: you used to walk around thinking there had
To be a reason for things, for everything. That way
Paranoia lies. Not a science of syllables, the solitude
You even thought you lived for them, until the first death
(A nervous uncle broke the news when you landed at Kennedy)
And the first marriage (you stayed up all night and read
 Beyond the Pleasure Principle, a fair description
Of your lovemaking). It seems that new myths are needed
And consumed all the time by folks like you. Each erases the last,
In which the tigers of wrath become the tigers of repose.
VIII.
Go back to the beginning, to the first fist fight.
They played for high stakes those days. The penalty for losing
Was death or slavery, take your pick. To spare a life
Was the mark of the master; the mark of his slave
Was fear. Noble savage, nothing. Forget about paradise.
The syllable that ends it also lends it its poignancy,
Since we go on wanting what we can scarcely bear.
Go back, go back, back to when god became a swan
With beautiful wounded wings, and raped the astonished maiden.
Back to the dream that stays real when you wake up,
Accustomed to your hunger and clinging to it,
Like a panther accustomed to his cage. Go back.
IX.
A slap in the face, and the face burns with shame.
Anger comes later, comes stranger, looking for someone to blame.
their sails whiter than those
of the yachts in the bay, they come and go
on winged feet, most of them, or in sensible shoes.
July, and I should be climbing among stones
or diving, but for broken bones,
from the rocks below.
I try to read
a new novel set aside;
but a sword-swift pain
in the left shoulderblade, the result
of a tumble in Sheridan Square, makes reading difficult:
writing you can do in your head.
It starts to rain
on the sea,
suddenly dark, the pier,
the gardens and the church spires of Dun Laoghaire.
You would think it was suddenly October
as smoke flaps, the yachts tack violently
and those caught in the downpour
run for cover.
But in a few
minutes the sun shines again,
the leaves and hedges glisten as if with dew
in that fragrant freshness after rain
when the world seems made anew
before confusion, before pain;
and I think of you,
a funny-face
but solemn, with the sharpest mind I know,
a thoughtful creature of unconscious grace
bent to your books in the sun or driving down
to New York for an evening on the town.
Doors open wherever you go
in that furious place;
for you are the light
the old poets saw gleam in the morning mist.
When you walk down Fifth Avenue in your lavender suit,
your pony eyes opaque, I am the one
beside you, and life is bright
with the finest and best.
And I have seen,
as you have not, such is your modesty,
men turn to watch your tangle of golden hair,
your graceful carriage and unhurried air
as if you belonged to history
You might have been
a saint or a great
courtesan, anachronistic now
in some ways, in some ways more up-to-date
than the most advanced of those we know.
While you sit on your sun-porch in Connecticut
re-reading Yeats in a feminist light
I am there with you.

My mother's maids, when they did sew and spin,
They sang sometime a song of the field mouse,
That, for because her livelood was but thin,

The television in The Deer Hunter is in Clairton, Pennsylvania. Everything is still at
calm, all is bright. I sing in English while my father is in Vietnam. American wives
are in immeasurable pain and so is my mother. American soldiers are pushing a hel-
icopter to the right side of the TV screen. Behind the soldiers is number 19. It stands
calm and bright, looking down at the flight platform below. Nobody is crying. Num-
child. And Godzilla is still crying. Hannah ditches the helicopter in the sea. Now

helicopter and its blades are perfectly vertical to the South China Sea. The chopper

though only that morning, I'd bent my head at the bell
and with the host on my tongue, mumbled thanks.

I told the nurses jokes,
newly precocious, but too old

at twelve to be anything
but a patient. I slouched in my robe
among the other child-guests of St. Joseph,

the parrot-eyed scald masks,
the waterheads and harelips,
the fat girl with the plastic shunt.

The old crippled nun on her wheeled
platform dispensed her half-witted blessings,
then was gone like the occasional covered gurneys

sliding by my numbered door. Gone
orderly as dusk in the brick courtyard:

the blank windows curtained one by one.
I could not abide that yearning face
calling me home. Like the Gauls,

in my penciled translations: I saw
Caesar was my home. Through the streets
of the occupied city, his gold mask rose, implacable.

I imagined pain not as pain
but the flickering light embedded

in the headboard, the end
of the snake-wire uncoiling from
the nurses' station. The painkiller winked

in its paper cup, its bleak chirp
meant respect should be paid
for the way I too wielded oblivion,

staring at the wall till six,
gifts unopened in her lap,

the early dark deepening between us.

The rain set early in to-night, 
It tore the elm-tops down for spite, 
When glided in Porphyria; straight 
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate 
Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl, 
Her hat and let the damp hair fall, 
She put my arm about her waist, 
And all her yellow hair displaced, 
To set its struggling passion free 
But passion sometimes would prevail, 
A sudden thought of one so pale 
Be sure I looked up at her eyes 
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise 
That moment she was mine, mine, fair, 
A thing to do, and all her hair 
And strangled her. No pain felt she; 
As a shut bud that holds a bee, 
And I untightened next the tress 
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss: 
Her head, which droops upon it still: 
So glad it has its utmost will, 
Porphyria's love: she guessed not how 
And thus we sit together now, 

At the Mind Museum, you can walk to the back,
step on several large buttons on the ground,

and watch parts of the brain light up: the frontal lobe
for decision and memory, the temporal lobe

for smell and sound, the occipital for sight. I try
to make my toddler son laugh by hopping

from one button to the next, watching each lobe
light up along the way, but he will not leave the prison

of his melancholy. My son: how he loves to revisit
the most difficult point of conflict in a picture book,

or the moment at which his favorite car heaves

arc, or the promise of injury if I take a fall. My son,
so distant from other children in his sadness.

Just the other day, at the pool, he gazed
at the boys and girls splashing and shrieking

and said, Look. The children are having fun,
as if he were an anthropologist in a foreign land.

If these are his musings at age two, one can only
imagine the life that must follow. Through a dark channel

he was born; to darkness he is most drawn. Easier
to write than say the guilt I feel for giving him

the sharp pain of melancholy. My son, always
in the world without husk or shell, it is as if his heart

throbs on the outside of his body, as if his brain
has no skull to absorb the assaults that strike it.

a typical kid, this is what they do, everyone assures 

his sense of emergency. Instead, today, I stand back,

relinquish the role of skull and skin, watch his mind
unfurl like a medieval tapestry. In that moment

of my feigned disinterest, his head is no longer head
but battlefield where Wrath wages a fierce war

against Patience. He is no longer a little boy
screaming on the ground and throwing plastic trucks;

instead he is a creature engaged in a struggle
to free his enslaved heart from the monsters

whose foaming mouths and hot fumes
and clots of foul blood besiege him

as he gathers his thoughts from the unraveling 
of his universe. Prudentius says that fiery Wrath

in her frenzy slays herself and dies
by her own weapons. I will watch and wait

for my son to close his mind from the anger
and sorrow that fester in him, but if the mind

does not close, I hope I can hide the weapons
before, one day, it is too late.

the other day i was thinking about the term pyramid scheme, and why they called it pyramid scheme and not triangle scheme
and i asked you what you thought
unconsciously suggesting a silent wealth of gold and heat
a triangle is two dimensional, and therefore
a less striking mental image than the idea of a third dimension of financial fraud
which is how many dimensions of financial fraud the term pyramid scheme suggests
but i had to pause for a second at the financial fraud part
i knew they had something to do with people getting money from nothing
like
the person at the top of the pyramid scheme, or more accurately
triangle scheme, acquires a number of investors and takes their money
and then pays the first lot of investors with the money from another bunch of investors
and so on and so forth
all the way to the bottom of the triangle
or pyramid face
which is the kind of stupid thing that happens
if you keep your money in a pyramid and not a bank account
although if you ask me banks are the real pyramid schemes after all

and i should shop around and compare the interest rates on different pyramids
maybe i should open up a savings pyramid
with a whole bunch of trapdoors and malarias
to keep the financial anthropologists
i mean bankers out

i think this was supposed to be a metaphor for something
whatever
but knowing me, it was probably love
that cartoon black castle with a single bird flying over it

how far below the sand
and you and I are a little drunk
you answer the phone
you pour me a drink
i know you hate the domestic in poetry but you should have thought of that before you invited me to move in with you
i used to think arguments were the same as honesty
i used to think screaming was the same as passion
i used to think pain was meaningful
i no longer think pain is meaningful
i never learned anything good from being unhappy
i never learned anything good from being happy either
the way i feel about you has nothing to do with learning
it has nothing to do with anything
but i feel it down in the corners of my sarcophagus
i feel it in my sleep
even when i am not thinking about you
you are still pouring through my blood, like fire through an abandoned hospital ward
these coins are getting heavy on my eyes

when i look at you my eyes bulge out of my skull like a dog in a cartoon
when i am with you

and i feel like i am sinking into the deepest part of my life
we walk down the street, with the grass blowing back and forth
i have never been so happy

It seems clear enough that there is in the brain a particular pain-center,
where sensations of every variety check in, to emerge as anguish and
hurt. Thus there is not, as we might suppose, a multiplicity of pains,
like an arsenal deployed against us, but one pain which puts on, as in a
ritual theater, different masks.

A scream from outside broke our argument and I ran to the door, rushed

which way to turn.

That marsh hawk,
its blown-leaf flight 
across Tomales Bay fog, 
the Pacific tide pressuring
and squeezing wave on wave 
We feel somehow between us
still water crushed by that sea,
so constant it seems not to be.
The hawk, a circus, tumbles,
stops, stands upon the air,
beats its wings as if to shoo 
and its clapping wings stop
our unstoppable argument,
that love goes, who knows why,
and delivers us from pain 
to pain, air with teeth 
Northern harrier, owl face, 
they sea-changed your name,
who listens with your face
and shows not love but want, 
speed, life in flight 
toward, forever toward,
pausing at every chance
to use what ocean-born
bayside air sustains you
by resisting you. We thank
your sunken head bones
and wild close-to-water seeking
that somehow speaks to us,

After the storm, after the rain stopped pounding,
We stood in the doorway watching horses
We stared through the black screen,
Our vision altered by the distance
So I thought I saw a mist
Kicked up around their hooves when they faded
Like cut-out horses
Away from us.
The grass was never more blue in that light, more
Scarlet; beyond the pasture
Trees scraped their voices into the wind, branches
Crisscrossed the sky like barbed wire
But you said they were only branches.

Okay. The storm stopped pounding.
I am trying to say this straight: for once
I was sane enough to pause and breathe
Outside my wild plans and after the hard rain
I turned my back on the old curses. I believed
They swung finally away from me ...

But still the branches are wire
And thunder is the pounding mortar,
Still I close my eyes and see the girl
Running from her village, napalm
Stuck to her dress like jelly,
Her hands reaching for the no one
Who waits in waves of heat before her.

So I can keep on living,
So I can stay here beside you,
I try to imagine she runs down the road and wings
Beat inside her until she rises
Above the stinking jungle and her pain
Eases, and your pain, and mine.

But the lie swings back again.
The lie works only as long as it takes to speak
And the girl runs only as far
As the napalm allows
Until her burning tendons and crackling
Muscles draw her up
into that final position

Burning bodies so perfectly assume. Nothing
Can change that; she is burned behind my eyes
And not your good love and not the rain-swept air
And not the jungle green
Pasture unfolding before us can deny it.

Variable, changeable, yes, there are days when 

blades of grass lightly blowing them all one way. 

And then there are days when we feel April, 
the fields of April making us feel our bodies 

trembling to be touched: and under the influences 
of rains pouring down as if pure spirit poured 

sprouts and branches and entangles us 

in lush bowers and thickets of illusion. 

and bird passing over it, days when even our own pain 

and what we feel it to be like make us smile. 
disgusting, so sordid to ourselves 

off tossed coins of the good, the terrible 

shining with the gleam of that primal metal. 

And other days come, come when women 

touch the roundness of an apple or a pear, 

the round earth spins us off into space. 

And then there arrive days so dismal and stupefied 
and numb that the idiot soughing of a pine grove 

sounds like weeping: and what some idiot called 
the soul whines and wails and carries on 

and maybe not God himself, that absolute fool, 
can make that wind less cutting, or make it stop. 

And then there comes, certain to come, oh my earth 
I love beyond any of my days, a day . . . a day . . . a day 

when my sail catches the wind and drags the anchor 
up out of the bottom muck, and nothing can withstand 

the day when nobody and nothing can keep us 
from getting up and going, no matter who we are . . . 

the day when our leaving is the same as our arriving.

A storm and so a gift. 
A fence is flattened in

On the Gilfillan burial day, 
It was a most solemn sight to see, 
Not fewer than thirty thousand people assembled in Dundee, 
All watching the funeral procession of Gilfillan that day, 
That death had suddenly taken away, 

There were about three thousand people in the procession alone, 
And many were shedding tears, and several did moan, 
And their bosoms heaved with pain, 
Because they knew they would never look upon his like again. 

There could not be fewer than fifty carriages in the procession that day, 
And gentlemen in some of them that had come from far away, 
And in whispers some of them did say, 
As the hearse bore the precious corpse away, 
Along the Nethergate that day. 

For he never turned them empty-handed away from his door; 

There was a body of policemen marshalled in grand array, 
And marched in front of the procession all the way; 
And whose soul I hope to heaven has fled away, 
To sing with saints above for ever and aye. 

The Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council were in the procession that day; 
Also Mrs Gilfillan, who cried and sobbed all the way 
For her kind husband, that was always affable and gay, 
Which she will remember until her dying day. 

When the body of the great Gilfillan was lowered into the grave, 
And with tearful eyes and bated breath, 

Then she dropped a ringlet of immortelles into his grave, 
Then took one last fond look, and in sorrow did leave; 
And all the people left with sad hearts that day, 

everyday things people put in their letters,
and howlers only a mother would believe,
and reassuring fluff about the weather,
as if sun were sun, and his rain, like theirs,
could fill the cistern and make green things grow.
And here they were, grinning back at him,
every pitiful, dumb phrase he wrote,
copied over like a holy scripture
that made his snarled, uncontrollable scrawl
round and plan and easy to read.
Her ABCs were good enough to eat
slowly in the little oven of her hands
and strung into necklaces of script.
But if he read those letters at all,
his eyes scribbled some glare before he fed
the page, balled up, to the dark, muttering
demon of trash chained in the corner,
when, drunk or stoned, he plummeted straight down
above his swollen, already aging face.

And then. And then. And then.
And then no letter came back.
And soon no letter went forward.
Why listen now to people talking?
The demon settled into self-consumption.
And everything was still.
Dust silted over the phantom children
Though old now, he was still a son
without witnesses anywhere to say
if the promise had been kept or not kept.
what he had done with his heritage?
Then let their silence mute the judgment,
hush the accusation against him!
And now this little corner where he sat
need be no worse than any other
little corner of the universe.

And then one day a witness came forward
An old piece of paper.
Wrinkled. Worn.
Smudged with the dregs of big numbers.
And under their blur, in palest blue
was being true to the words it found.
But there, between the words, in the smeared void
he saw his sentence spelled out.
Of his waste life: pain. Of falsity: pain.
It was a lash. A lifeline. His lifeline
With a pencil stub he traced the faint line
of her letters across the yellowed page.
As faithfully as she, as patiently
He, too, was happy. He, too, was glad. He wrote.

"Courage!" he said, and pointed toward the land, 
"This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon." 
In the afternoon they came unto a land 
In which it seemed always afternoon. 
All round the coast the languid air did swoon, 
Breathing like one that hath a weary dream. 
Full-faced above the valley stood the moon; 
And like a downward smoke, the slender stream 
Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem. 

A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke, 
Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go; 
And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke, 
Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below. 
They saw the gleaming river seaward flow 
From the inner land: far off, three mountain-tops, 
Three silent pinnacles of aged snow, 
Stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops, 
Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse. 

The charmed sunset linger'd low adown 
In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the dale 
Was seen far inland, and the yellow down 
Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale 
And meadow, set with slender galingale; 
A land where all things always seem'd the same! 
And round about the keel with faces pale, 
Dark faces pale against that rosy flame, 
The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came. 

Branches they bore of that enchanted stem, 
Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave 
To each, but whoso did receive of them, 
And taste, to him the gushing of the wave 
Far far away did seem to mourn and rave 
On alien shores; and if his fellow spake, 
His voice was thin, as voices from the grave; 
And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake, 
And music in his ears his beating heart did make. 

They sat them down upon the yellow sand, 
Between the sun and moon upon the shore; 
And sweet it was to dream of Fatherland, 
Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore 
Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar, 
Weary the wandering fields of barren foam. 
Then some one said, "We will return no more"; 
And all at once they sang, "Our island home 
Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam." 

CHORIC SONG 
I 
There is sweet music here that softer falls 
Than petals from blown roses on the grass, 
Or night-dews on still waters between walls 
Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass; 
Music that gentlier on the spirit lies, 
Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd eyes; 
Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies. 
Here are cool mosses deep, 
And thro' the moss the ivies creep, 
And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep, 
And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep." 

II 
Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness, 
And utterly consumed with sharp distress, 
While all things else have rest from weariness? 
All things have rest: why should we toil alone, 
We only toil, who are the first of things, 
And make perpetual moan, 
Still from one sorrow to another thrown: 
Nor ever fold our wings, 
And cease from wanderings, 
Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm; 
Nor harken what the inner spirit sings, 
"There is no joy but calm!" 
Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things? 

III 
Lo! in the middle of the wood, 
The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud 
With winds upon the branch, and there 
Grows green and broad, and takes no care, 
Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon 
Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow 
Falls, and floats adown the air. 
Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light, 
The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow, 
Drops in a silent autumn night. 
All its allotted length of days 
The flower ripens in its place, 
Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil, 
Fast-rooted in the fruitful soil. 

IV 
Hateful is the dark-blue sky, 
Vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea. 
Death is the end of life; ah, why 
Should life all labour be? 
Let us alone. Time driveth onward fast, 
And in a little while our lips are dumb. 
Let us alone. What is it that will last? 
All things are taken from us, and become 
Portions and parcels of the dreadful past. 
Let us alone. What pleasure can we have 
To war with evil? Is there any peace 
In ever climbing up the climbing wave? 
All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave 
In silence; ripen, fall and cease: 
Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease. 

V 
How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream, 
With half-shut eyes ever to seem 
Falling asleep in a half-dream! 
To dream and dream, like yonder amber light, 
Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height; 
To hear each other's whisper'd speech; 
Eating the Lotos day by day, 
To watch the crisping ripples on the beach, 
And tender curving lines of creamy spray; 
To lend our hearts and spirits wholly 
To the influence of mild-minded melancholy; 
To muse and brood and live again in memory, 
With those old faces of our infancy 
Heap'd over with a mound of grass, 
Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass! 

VI 
Dear is the memory of our wedded lives, 
And dear the last embraces of our wives 
And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change: 
For surely now our household hearths are cold, 
Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange: 
And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy. 
Or else the island princes over-bold 
Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings 
Before them of the ten years' war in Troy, 
And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things. 
Is there confusion in the little isle? 
Let what is broken so remain. 
The Gods are hard to reconcile: 
'Tis hard to settle order once again. 
There is confusion worse than death, 
Trouble on trouble, pain on pain, 
Long labour unto aged breath, 
Sore task to hearts worn out by many wars 
And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars. 

VII 
But, propt on beds of amaranth and moly, 
How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly) 
With half-dropt eyelid still, 
Beneath a heaven dark and holy, 
To watch the long bright river drawing slowly 
To hear the dewy echoes calling 
To watch the emerald-colour'd water falling 
Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine! 
Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine, 
Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine. 

VIII 
The Lotos blooms below the barren peak: 
The Lotos blows by every winding creek: 
All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone: 
Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone 
Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown. 
We have had enough of action, and of motion we, 
Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething free, 
Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea. 
Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind, 
In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined 
On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind. 
For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd 
Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd 
Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world: 
Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands, 
Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands, 
Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands. 
But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song 
Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong, 
Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong; 
Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil, 
Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil, 
Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil; 
Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell, 
Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel. 
Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore 
Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar; 
O, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more. 

Tell me a story, father please,
And then I sat upon his knees.
Or tell the words of native tone,
Of how my Indian fathers dwelt,
And, of sore oppression felt;
And how they mourned a land serene,
Of every pain they did forego,
Oh, please to tell me all you know.
In history often I do read,
Of pain which none but they did heed.
When we no tongue but ours did trace,
We were in ever peace,
Our brethren, far remote, and far unknown,
And spake to them in silent, tender tone.
We all were then as in one band,
Our dress was suited to the clime,
By European men; who then had need
Of this far country. Columbus came afar,
And thus before we could say Ah!
Though some were kind, yet others then held bands
We sold, then some bought lands,
We altogether moved in foreign hands.
Wars ensued. They knew the handling of firearms.
They will not cruelly us oppress,
Or thus our lands possess.
To seek a refuge.
Unfelt! Alas! No tender tone
To cheer us when the hunt is done;
Oh! silent the horror, and fierce the fight,
When my brothers were shrouded in night;
Our fathers are sleeping who lived in the time
That I tell. Oh! could I tell them my grief
In its flow, that in roaming, we find no relief.
I love my country, and shall, until death
Shall cease my breath.
Shall sink, to rise no more;
And if my years should score,

Somewhat back from the village street 
Stands the old-fashioned country-seat. 
Across its antique portico 
Tall poplar-trees their shadows throw; 
And from its station in the hall 

Half-way up the stairs it stands, 
And points and beckons with its hands 
From its case of massive oak, 
Like a monk, who, under his cloak, 
Crosses himself, and sighs, alas! 

By day its voice is low and light; 
But in the silent dead of night, 
Distinct as a passing footstep's fall, 
It echoes along the vacant hall, 
Along the ceiling, along the floor, 

Through days of sorrow and of mirth, 
Through days of death and days of birth, 
Through every swift vicissitude 
Of changeful time, unchanged it has stood, 
And as if, like God, it all things saw, 

In that mansion used to be 
Free-hearted Hospitality; 
His great fires up the chimney roared; 
The stranger feasted at his board; 
But, like the skeleton at the feast, 

There groups of merry children played, 
There youths and maidens dreaming strayed; 
O precious hours! O golden prime, 
And affluence of love and time! 
Even as a miser counts his gold, 

From that chamber, clothed in white, 
The bride came forth on her wedding night; 
There, in that silent room below, 
The dead lay in his shroud of snow; 
And in the hush that followed the prayer, 

All are scattered now and fled, 
Some are married, some are dead; 
And when I ask, with throbs of pain, 
"Ah! when shall they all meet again?" 
As in the days long since gone by, 

Never here, forever there, 
Where all parting, pain, and care, 
Forever there, but never here! 
The horologe of Eternity 

From the beginning, the egg cradled in pebbles,
The drive thick with fledglings, to the known last
Riot of the senses, is only a short pass.
Earth to be forked over is more patient,
Bird hungers more, flower dies sooner.

But if not grasped grows quickly, silently.
We are restless, not remembering much.
The pain is slow, original as laughter,
Reaching for all of it, hardly aware,
Beginning again and feeling for its terrain.

We were often told and still we would not listen,
And closing fingers, those accomplices,
Took comfort from a lie. From lap to grass
Whining, motionless on the lowest branch
Above the pine needles, climbing the heather:

We did not listen. It hid there still to find.
Much since was hard to get, later displeased,
Nursing an ordinary complaint or waiting
For a reiterated brilliance,
Growing in ignorance, too near to see.

Now in the suburbs windows are on fire,
Pale globes quiver on their dusty strings
And afternoons disperse with mirth of gnome,
The rigid stabbed flamingo pink in the trees,
Split to the touch and walking by the pool.

Now life jerking in its sustained coda
Constricts its furniture and its events.
The frowning bus disappears down the hill
Or slides before the window with its bored
Passengers staring unashamedly in.

Electric tongue stammers its recitation.
Children run out in the dumb-bell cul-de-sac
To their cold delight, skipping between the turds
Of long-dead dogs, coiled thickly on the stone.

The children learn so quickly. The house stirs.
Swallows leave earlier, apples to be pressed.
Half the sky burns: the other half is dark.
Hair pushing slowly out, generations
Surrounding us with wonder, theirs and ours.

Nothing to give, nothing has been learnt.
The past simply denies the urge for a truce,
Creeping into the egg. When it is time
We can appoint a committee for the feasts,

Locks stick, glass metamorphosed
In leafy caryatids of summer where
Heat packs the panes and fingers tremble in
Tobacco pockets, a tomato sniffed,
Its greenish acid bloom and tiny hairs.

The pain stirs again like a new life
To be unravelled. It had to come to this.
The body is nothing, the body thinks nothing,
The short senses grubbing on their sticks
Feel nothing, the forgotten carioca.

A line moves to the finger end, and curls,
Head fallen in helplessness. The wails
Of children break behind the woven fences,
Those minted faces tar beyond our sight.
The gates shut: a parade of Japanese flags.

And alive on the porch the councillor lowers his pipe,
Comes down from the dunes a bathroom Arab
Firing off caps, or crouched over shells
Gathered in sodden pumps, the soprano waitress
Bringing hot tea across the evening sand.

The nights come in slowly. Behind a half-curtain
The impossible is completed. A single lamp
Weighs down its ornaments in pools of light.
Shadows crawl over the crater, roped

 A pity, how we misspeak and mishear. 

makes a difference to the increasingly cooler 

do we know, amateurs that we are? Loon, shmoon. 
It might have been dying, announcing 

its pain in those trilling pennants. It might 
have been the girl who was lost in these woods last week 

and never found by the volunteer searchers, 
it might have been her ghost 

with an admonishment. The truth is, 

from pleasure, not in our beds, our hearts, the tone 
of a poem on the final exam (a coin-toss). A pity, because 

we know the urgency of some utterance; 
and the intended goodwill of our listening; and 

the marvelous basic mechanics of speech, 

and she added that tired magic about how atoms 
of Julius Caesar and Napoleon and Beethoven did 

their fleet anachronistic dance in every inhalation 
of ours, although at thirteen I preferred to think 

inflating her see-through empresswear 

Shakespeare, Madame Curie populating my oxygen, 
but also the smelly and scabby old man 

when the late-shift ward nurse heard (as she said in her testimony) 

an unfortunate example of my theme . . . although 
exempla abound, misapprehension 

also dancing inside us at the atomic level. 
Someone thought the gate was locked, she always locked 

the gate in the late afternoon when the haze set down 
and the sun for a moment seemed to carmelize the lake top, 

or a scraggle of hair or a single ribbon. I tell you 

of the minutiae of our own lives. When I heard the sounds 
that gurgled from my chest as my wife was leaving 

into the dense, conspiratorial Austin, Texas night,

and that our total errors, if spread out flat, 

inside us, along with the cardiac and the pulmonary,

we call the future. Even now, as you read this, 
someone in that unknowable distance 

is breathing you in. 

She said: the pitying audience melt in tears, 
But Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears. 
In vain Thalestris with reproach assails, 
For who can move when fair Belinda fails? 
Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain, 
While Anna begg'd and Dido rag'd in vain. 
Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan; 
Silence ensu'd, and thus the nymph began. 

It was past twelve on a mid-winter night, 
Darkness; the distant wink of a huge gun. 

No thorny crown, only a woollen cap 
That Lancaster on Lune may stand secure. 

He faced me, reeling in his weariness, 

To this man, to his boned shoulders
Came the descent of pain.
All kinds,
Cruel, blind, dear, horrid, hallowed,
Rained, again, again.

To this small white blind boned face,
Wherever it was,
Descended
The blows of pain, it took as it were blinded,
As it were made for this.

We were there. We uneasy
Did not know if it were.
Knew neither
The reason nor the man nor whether
To share, or to beware.

And crowds with crimes the records of mankind,
For gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws,
For gold the hireling judge distorts the laws;
The dangers gather as the treasures rise.

And dubious title shakes the madded land,
When statutes glean the refuse of the sword,
How much more safe the vassal than the lord,

Today, this moment, speechlessly in pain,
He fights the terror of being poured out,
The fall into darkness unquenchably long
So that even as he hurtles he keeps holding

Can stop that surge, already he swirls
To the source of Voices, the many throats inside the one
Throat, each swallowing the unstoppable flood ...

And as if that, all along, were what he'd wanted,
He hears the Voices begin to die down
The way a marsh in spring pulsing and shrilling
Sunup to sundown falls gradually still

When his every last drop has been poured out.

2. Countdown

In your hospital bed, the plastic mask across
Your face siphoning air into your lungs,
You lie helpless as an astronaut
Blasting into space: Eyes oblivious

To ours, your body's fevered presence
Shimmers like the phantom heat that will trail
Up the pipe of the crematory oven:
How distant we will seem after

Such intensity ... We drift in your stare
Like the dust stirred by the cow your parents
Gave you as a boy to teach responsibility.

Already you are space immeasurable
By your slide rule, your graphs that plotted
Payload, liftoff, escape velocity.

3. Prayer

In the house of the dead I pace the halls:
The walls, collapsing, stretch away in desert
Or flatten into horizonless ocean.
I step outside, the door clicking shut

Comforting in its finality ...
Now I see the house as if I looked down
From far off mountains, and saw you crouching in
The sun-scoured yard, eyes keenly focused,

Pupils narrowing to a cat's green slits:
I can't look you in the face, you see only
The openness of sky rising above mountains.

(Only after the world had emptied
You and filled you with its openness
Will I feel the love I pray to feel?)

4. The God

a dream

A warming pulsing flood like blood surging through
Veins, and now the god stirs in my hands
Dull as stone in this gravity-less Nowhere.
Sensation shivering through me, deliberate and sure,

I cradle you, I sponge you clean
As if you were my son, the emptiness you
Drink like heavy black milk erasing
Your wrinkles and gouged lines of pain.

The god bends me to the work, my fingers driven
By the god, blinded by the god's
Neutrality, until I pull apart the threads
In this place the god commands:

Face wholly unwoven, without heart, mind, you
are nothing in my hands but my hands moving.

5. His Stare

Absently there in a moment of pure being
He sits in his chair, eyes locked, staring:
The air's transparence gains solidity
From his looking; while his emaciated features,

The way his flesh sags from sharpening cheekbones,
Make the summer air weigh like marble on the harsh green
Of the trees he is too weak to prune.
And yet the contemplative distance he is sealed in

Projects with ferocious purpose the will of his body
To withdraw into this eerily removed contemplation
Like one who has heard a tuning fork ringing
And enters and becomes each spectral vibration;

So utterly absorbed that love is a distraction; even
The world, its barest colors, bleeding away before that stare.

6. The Current

The numbing current of the Demorol
Sweeps him out to sea where the secret night
He lives in slowly begins to darken,
His daytime routine of watching his blood cycle

Through the tubes of a machine shadowed by blackness
Blinding as an underwater cave. Already
He filters the dark water through gills aligned
To strain that element he more and more resembles:

Like walls of water held in miraculous
Suspension, the moment of his death looms impartially
Above him, my hands holding his tightening
Its grip even as his hand loosens ...

As if my hand could lead him past that undulating
Weight towering above us out of sight.

7. The Rehearsal

I lead you back, your Orpheus, until you
Stand inhaling, on the topmost stair,
But like fumes rising from earth's molten core

The voices of the dead reach out to you,
Your whispering parents, dead for forty years,
Turn, as must you: Your footsteps die,

You dwindle, blur into unfillable
Space echoing like the dark of a cathedral ...
But there is no dark, no stair, no Orpheus

By breath in words you'll never read these
Lines stolen from your death.

When I go into the garden, there she is. 
The specter holds up her arms to show 
that her hands are eaten off. 
She is silent because of the agony. 
There is blood on her face. 
I can see she has done this to herself. 
So she would not feel the other pain. 
And it is true, she does not feel it. 
She does not even see me. 
It is not she anymore, but the pain itself 
that moves her. I look and think 
how to forget. How can I live while she 
stands there? And if I take her life 
what will that make of me? I cannot 
touch her, make her conscious. 
It would hurt her too much. 
I hear the sound all through the air 
that was her eating, but it is on its own now, 
completely separate from her. I think 
I am supposed to look. I am not supposed 
to turn away. I am supposed to see each detail 
and all expression gone. My God, I think, 
if paradise is to be here 
it will have to include her.

We speak of the pain of childbirth, referring, 
of course, to the mother, but what is pain 
to the mother, the one through whose body 
the course unwinds? She understands already 
what kind of world she must return to, 
how it daily hones its many edges 
against human skin, unlike the child whose 
untried limbs inch toward it, pressing now 
so firmly against her he feels for the first time 
the pinch of bone against bone and is seared 
by the friction. Isn't he the one 
on whom the real burden falls, the one 
to whom resilience means nothing yet? His 
tender skin like a small measure of cloth 
unfolding before the blade under which 
he will, for a lifetime, bruise 
and heal: Crush of the long descent, grip 
of the steadying hands, brush of breath 
against cheek, even the constant barrage 
of the microscopic, the tiny plink-plink 
of the dust motes knocking against him 
before custom makes him numb to it. No wonder 
the startled mouth cries out, 
each pore suddenly hungry 
in the withering, nourishing light.

I wonder how two people could consistently hurt each other,
but still feel love so deeply as their bones turned into dust?
Before Frida died, she painted a watermelon still life;
before his death, Diego did too.
I want to believe that those paintings were composed
during parallel moments because of their undying devotion.
If I close my eyes, I can see melon wedges left like
centerpieces except for the slice
one piece of fruit pecked at by a dove
that passed through a window.
and that the chances of me constructing a roll-top desk
are as slim as me building an Adirondack chair that sits plumb,
The knots in my back might not be there
if I had listened to her suggestions,
and I could well have done without two hours of silence
over a few holes in the wall.
But somehow, life has its ways of working things out.
This afternoon, I shut the blinds,
turned off the TV, lights, and phone,
her second one this week despite
the prophylactics and pain killers that we store in the breadbox.
nausea, blindness, and pain that strike
when the cranial vessels dilate,
fill with blood, leak, and make the brain swell.
Earlier, an MRI triggered the reaction as it mapped her head
with electrical current, gradient magnets, and radio waves
hammering her floundering eyes.
For now, we have our room, the bed frame, and the mattress
where she lies as I knead her toes.
the breeze stirring the lemon, lime, and orange trees
that I planted along the back fence.
On certain nights, the moon turns our lawn
into green acrylic where we sip Syrah and mint tea
until all we know is the sound
of our breathing among the whispering leaves.

At six I lived for spells:
how a few Hawaiian words could call
up the rain, could hymn like the sea
in the long swirl of chambers
curling in the nautilus of a shell,
could conjure money from the poor
and give them nothing but mantras,
the strange syllables that healed desire.

I lived for stories about the war
my grandfather told over hana cards,
slapping them down on the mats
with a sharp Japanese kiai.

I lived for songs my grandmother sang
stirring curry into a thick stew,
into grass mats and straw sandals.

I lived for the red volcano dirt
staining my toes, the salt residue
of surf and sea wind in my hair,
the arc of a flat stone skipping
in the hollow trough of a wave.

for my father to drag himself home,
dusted with blasts of sand, powdered
and the strange ash of raw cement,
his deafness made worse by the clang
of pneumatic drills, sore in his bones
from the buckings of a jackhammer.

let me unlace the hightop G.I. boots,
that day in school, write it for him
with hands that felt like gravel roads,
walk to the laundry sink to scrub,
rinse the dirt of his long day
from a face brown and grained as koa wood.

I wanted to take away the pain
in his legs, the swelling in his joints,
give him back his hearing,
clear and rare as crystal chimes,
the fins of glass that wrinkled
and sparked the air with their sound.

I wanted to heal the sores that work
and war had sent to him,
let him play catch in the backyard
with me, tossing a tennis ball
past papaya trees without the shoulders
of pain shrugging back his arms.

I wanted to become a doctor of pure magic,
to string a necklace of sweet words
fragrant as pine needles and plumeria,
fragrant as the bread my mother baked,
place it like a lei of cowrie shells
and chant him a blessing, a sutra.

They turn the water off, so I live without water,
they build walls higher, so I live without treetops,
they paint the windows black, so I live without sunshine,
they lock my cage, so I live without going anywhere,
they take each last tear I have, I live without tears,
they take my heart and rip it open, I live without heart,
they take my life and crush it, so I live without a future,
they say I am beastly and fiendish, so I have no friends,
they stop up each hope, so I have no passage out of hell,
they give me pain, so I live with pain,
they give me hate, so I live with my hate,
they have changed me, and I am not the same man,
they give me no shower, so I live with my smell,
they separate me from my brothers, so I live without brothers,
who understands me when I say this is beautiful?
who understands me when I say I have found other freedoms?

I cannot fly or make something appear in my hand,
I cannot make the heavens open or the earth tremble,
I can live with myself, and I am amazed at myself, my love,
my beauty,
I am taken by my failures, astounded by my fears,
I am stubborn and childish,
in the midst of this wreckage of life they incurred,
I practice being myself,
and I have found parts of myself never dreamed of by me,
they were goaded out from under rocks in my heart
when the walls were built higher,
when the water was turned off and the windows painted black.
I followed these signs
like an old tracker and followed the tracks deep into myself,
followed the blood-spotted path,
deeper into dangerous regions, and found so many parts of myself,
who taught me water is not everything,
and gave me new eyes to see through walls,
and when they spoke, sunlight came out of their mouths,
and I was laughing at me with them,
we laughed like children and made pacts to always be loyal,
who understands me when I say this is beautiful?

CORRECTION: the last line of the first stanza was corrected to read "who understands me when I say I have found other freedoms?", and the first line of the second stanza was corrected to read "I cannot fly or make something appear in my hand," on November 15, 2010.

And then I thought, Can I have more
of this, would it be possible
for every day to be a greater awakening: more light,
more light, your face on the pillow
with the sleep creases rudely
fragmenting it, hair so stiff
from paint and sheet rock it feels
like the dirty short hank
before he hauled me up and forward,
white flanks flecked green
the livingness, the warmth
of all that blood just under the skin
He was smarter than most of the children
I went to school with. He knew
how to stand with just the crescent
of his hoof along a boot toe and press,
incrementally, his whole weight down. The pain
so surprising when it came,
its iron intention sheathed in stealth, the decisive
sudden twisting of his leg until the hoof
to push him off, that hot
insistence with its large horse eye trained

Like us, he knew how to announce through violence
despite our practiced ministrations: too young
not to try to empathize
with this cunning: this thing
that was and was not human we must respect
for itself and not our imagination of it: I loved him because
I could not love him anymore
watching the slim bodies of teenagers
guide their geldings in figure eights around the ring
as if they were one body, one fluid motion
of electric understanding I would never feel
working its way through fingers to the bit: this thing
had a name, a need, a personality; it possessed
an indifference that gave me
logic and a measure: I too might stop wanting
the hand placed on back or shoulder
and never feel the desired response.
I loved the horse for the pain it could imagine

and inflict on me, the sudden jerking
of head away from halter, the tentative nose
inspecting first before it might decide
to relent and eat. I loved
what was not slave or instinct, that when you turn to me
it is a choice, it is always a choice to imagine pleasure
might be blended, one warmth
bleeding into another as the future
bleeds into the past, more light, more light,
your hand against my shoulder, the image
of the one who taught me disobedience
is the first right of being alive.

Memory was the room I entered down a long corridor
Thrown by the white drugs of pain though pain
Was adrift on a glassy stream of green tide
Where images flickered and ran on

In those days but to grab the attention
Of readers nearby who had been crushed by life
Who floated across the exercise yard like headaches

Smoking rag-cigarettes looking sideways
For the next punishment for a break or maybe distraction
Chips of memory kept rising to the surface
Of our minds to take another bite

I had no idea why poetry the squid caught me
It clung to my brain in the damaging climate
A creature in the alien element of air
Arising from centuries of survival

Thoughts must be inky and capable
Of working the bait with a black beak
For a quick kill and a metaphysical rise up through the abyss
Poetry in those days was a handmade lure

There were no fish or birds so I spun my lines
To the ones with heads spring-loaded with resentment
Their temper a red fleck twitching in an eye
While poems of the future waited in line to hear my number

Many in aftertimes will say of you
   Not that I loved you more than just in play,
Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
   Of love and parting in exceeding pain.
   Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
But by my heart of love laid bare to you.
   My love that you can make not void nor vain,
Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
   Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
   My love of you was life and not a breath.

with Dana Ward
I have so little want of activity
even writing with its pain more terrible than life
not in the way, you, Sarah know I am
nor, you reader, who think of me fishing.
Line, spindle, lure, bait. Instruments for me
are accessories, even the matchbook is only
a tiara to my eyes, the fishing lure a long
& white bracelet. Some of my
so-called friends think of me as a derelict
they always try to hold me to account.
On the witness stand I am a kitten
about stupid, or fish, or last night.
I like to lay at the base of a hill
asleep while the shepherds work
bringing things to heel with tepid will where I source
my contempt in the index of swill.
The entries there make no mention of hell
which was sifted through the vale of tears, & fell
to make Earth, & the base of this hill where I sunbathe & murmur

It begins simply with a fist, white-knuckled
and tight, glossy with sweat. With two eyes
in a rearview mirror watching for a convoy.
The radio a soundtrack that adrenaline has
pushed into silence, replacing it with a heartbeat,
his thumb trembling over the button.
as he lights a Miami, draws in the smoke
and waits in his taxi at the traffic circle.
He thinks of summer 1974, lifting
pitchforks of grain high in the air,
and although it was decades ago, he still loves her,
remembers her standing at the canebrake
where the buffalo cooled shoulder-deep in the water,
pleased with the orange cups of flowers he brought her,
and he regrets how so much can go wrong in a life,
how easily the years slip by, light as grain, bright
traveling at the speed of sound to open him up
in blood and shock, a man whose last thoughts
are of love and wreckage, with no one there
to whisper him gone.
Sgt. Ledouix of the National Guard
speaks but cannot hear the words coming out,
because it lends the world a certain calm,
though the traffic circle is filled with people
running in panic, their legs a blur
like horses in a carousel, turning
and turning the way the tires spin
on the Humvee flipped to its side,
a mystery to him now, a dark hole
in metal the color of sand, and if he could,
he would crawl back inside of it,
and though his fingertips scratch at the asphalt
shrapnel has torn into his ribcage
and he will bleed to death in ten minutes,
but he finds himself surrounded by a strange
beauty, the shine of light on the broken,
the way his wife might, amazed to find
a wedding ring on his crushed hand,
the bright gold sinking in flesh
going to bone.
Rasheed passes the bridal shop
on a bicycle, with Sefa beside him,
and just before the air ruckles and breaks
he glimpses the sidewalk reflections
in the storefront glass, men and women
walking and talking, or not, an instant
of clarity, just before each of them shatters
as if even the idea of them were being
destroyed, stripped of form,
the blast tearing into the manikins
who stood as though husband and wife
a moment before, who cannot touch
one another, who cannot kiss,
who now lie together in glass and debris,
holding one another in their half-armed embrace,
calling this love, if this is all there will ever be.
The civil affairs officer, Lt. Jackson, stares
at his missing hands, which make
no sense to him, no sense at all, to wave
these absurd stumps held in the air
out the Humvee window, his left hand holding the bottle,
his right hand dipping the plastic ring in soap,
filling the air behind them with floating spheres
like the oxygen trails of deep ocean divers,
something for the children, something beautiful,
translucent globes with their iridescent skins
drifting on vehicle exhaust and the breeze
that might lift one day over the Zagros mountains,
that kind of hope, small globes which may have
astonished someone on the sidewalk
seven minutes before Lt. Jackson blacks out
from blood loss and shock, with no one there to bandage
the wounds that would carry him home.
Nearby, an old woman cradles her grandson,
whispering, rocking him on her knees
as though singing him to sleep, her hands
wet with their blood, her black dress
soaked in it as her legs give out
and she buckles with him to the ground.
if she could see herself an old woman
begging by the roadside for money, here,
with a bomb exploding at the market
To have your heart broken one last time
before dying, to kiss a child given sight
And the man who triggered the button,
he is everywhere, he is of all things,
his touch is the air taken in, the blast
and wave, the electricity of shock,
his is the sound the heart makes quick
searching for light and color, that sound
the martyr cries filled with the word
his soul is made of, Inshallah.
Still hanging in the air over Ashur Square,
the telephone line snapped in two, crackling
a strange incantation the dead hear
as they wander confused amongst one another,
the living in their grief, to console
those who cannot accept such random pain,
speaking habib softly, one to another there
in the rubble and debris, habib
over and over, that it might not be forgotten.

And won't be taking prayers til ten.

As if your wants could keep you warm. 

As if. You say your shibboleths. 
You thumb your beads. You scry the glass. 
Night creeps to its precipice 

And the broken rim of reason breaks 
Again. An obsidian sky betrays you. 
Every serrate shadow flays you. 

Soon enough, the crow will caw.

And so wee, wet hours of grief relent.  
In thirty years you might forget 
Precisely how tonight's pain felt.

I repeat my journeys to seek the
happiness that overcame
your absence
I was happy not to love you anymore

and broke my raft apart
there were other rivers underground
covered with dead flowers
it was cold it was cold yes it was

And the man said, what has the dead man left
if not to be philosophical,
to solve the deep meaning of it all.

The man peeked in himself and knew
in this life there is no riddle.

the dead man manages his miserable dead existence.
And as will happen to a man asleep with his mouth open who dreams a dream
so a friendly wise guy stops all of a sudden overhead and drops his pants to take a leak 
in his mouth for a lark
and the sleeping man leaps up in pained surprise
and shakes his head and spits and wipes the ordure from his mouth
and for a moment the human world is lit before him with a burning glow that nauseates
thus the mud is stuffed and the water drawn to fill
the hollow in the open mouth of the dead man
and the dead man does not jump and does not spit and does not protest,
and only the pained surprise on his face does not fade.

And the dead man got sick with sorrow and his flesh wasted away
and his pale lips ate back from the rim of his mouth, and his teeth bared a foolish grin
and for all he tried to shut his grin, that smile of the embarrassed dead, apologetic,
to swathe his face in a severe frown of wrath as befits one in pain,
the more his teeth unveiled, and the grin broadened, and stretched from ear to ear
and became the twisted crude laugh of a good for nothing.

All the dead lie flat, laughing crudely toward heaven
as if they saw over them hope wink
like a troupe of ugly women chortling at a disco

And the dead man takes to heart the fact that he will not soon rise from this hole
so he says, how shall a man spend his death, what remains
if not to ponder, study, and resolve the riddle of his days.

and his brain is not flooded with the poisoned blood of lust
and he bears a certain resemblance to a poet sitting at the foot of a mountain,
staring at the sky revealed between the tops of the trees
till suddenly the mountain falls on him and buries him beneath

Then the dead man lights the dim lantern of his memory, that tends to gutter
to rummage after the secret of his life, its joy, sorrow and meaning.
But as the man gnaws through his soul, his soul is full of magazines,
in all the basement of his soul roll only tatters of magazines
and piles and piles of newspapers fill even the hidden chambers of his heart that are unknown.

his daily bread at noon while life he lived,
and oh the little typeface sweet and crisp, melting in your mouth!
And at noon he grasped the evening paper,
and his hand brushed it even at nighttime,
and even the next day he fondled it a bit,
so newspapers filled him till there was not room for anything else.

Even at noon on the day of his death, while still he lived in sweat,
the man read as he sat to his repast, lots of news items
about what was happening in Iran 
and the family of the Shah of Iran
and about the American reaction
and about the strange dealings between
the ministers of Trade and Treasury in our fair land.
These were the last things his soul pondered
the man who lived at noon on the day of his death.
got to where he got to,
and in this confusion over the Shah of Iran
death jumped on him suddenly in all its rage.

(he and his wife and his three children had applied there for asylum)
and the minister of Trade and Treasury and noted matchmaker Venus Katz,
and many more Presidents and ministers and generals and members of parliament
and pimps and car thieves and television presenters and football players,
they and their wives and their kids in a great milling multitude
with all the ordure accompanying them from the depths of the newspapers,
and eating and moving their bowels and making a mess, they spit and suppurate
smeared with the vapor of these people and their sweat,
that rises in a stink from the prattle of their mouths and breath of their noses,
and from their armpits and holes in their loins and goop between their toenails
with the spat out shells and crumbs and empty sweet wrappers of men 

and that his soul was shaped like an army crapper
and so many torn ends of evening newspaper
roll there and every tear of newspaper 
contains a tail end of crumpled news or squished story
and is wiped in the middle with a good wipe and rolls on the earth to where it will.

The Shah of Iran laughed, and his children laughed in turn
and the minister of Trade and Treasury laughed (one by one),
and around them a multitude laughs and cheers and celebrates.

And the dead man cried a desperate cry for his base life that was lost,
for it was choked in the hollow of his mouth that was stuffed with earth.

And not a sound was heard at the graveside, and there was silence
except for a little simmering, a whispering hiss,
like the sound of a silent fart, 
like the sound of a flute that plays so quiet,
and makes such a sad romantic noise.

And the dead man was shown as an empty vessel
and the riddle of his base life
was a foot pad for the soles of the shoes
of the relations of the Shah of Iran.

And his lips lap with an obsequious grin
the exchange rate of the dollar and price of kerosene.

The common woman is as common
as a rattlesnake.

My prime of youth is but a frost of cares, 
My feast of joy is but a dish of pain, 
My crop of corn is but a field of tares, 
And all my good is but vain hope of gain. 
The day is gone and yet I saw no sun, 
And now I live, and now my life is done. 

The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung, 
The fruit is dead, and yet the leaves are green, 
My youth is gone, and yet I am but young, 
I saw the world, and yet I was not seen, 
My thread is cut, and yet it was not spun, 
And now I live, and now my life is done. 

I sought my death and found it in my womb, 
I lookt for life and saw it was a shade, 
I trode the earth and knew it was my tomb, 
And now I die, and now I am but made. 
The glass is full, and now the glass is run, 
And now I live, and now my life is done.

Brave comrade, answer! When you joined the war,
 You loved your home, your kindred, children, wife;
 That which made Abraham bare the priestly knife,

The happy ones are almost always also vulgar; 
happiness has a way of thinking 
that's rushed and has no time to look 
but keeps on moving, compact and manic, 
with contempt in passing for the dying: 
Get on with your life, come on, buck up! 

Those stilled by pain don't mix 
with the cheerful, self-assured runners 
but with those who walk at the same slow pace. 
If one wheel locks and the other's turning 
the turning one doesn't stop turning 
but goes as far as it can, dragging the other 
in a poor, skewed race until the cart 
either comes to a halt or falls apart.

Corinna, pride of Drury-Lane 
For whom no shepherd sighs in vain; 
Never did Covent Garden boast 
So bright a battered, strolling toast; 
No drunken rake to pick her up, 
No cellar where on tick to sup; 
Returning at the midnight hour; 
Then, seated on a three-legged chair, 
Takes off her artificial hair: 
Now, picking out a crystal eye, 
She wipes it clean, and lays it by. 
Stuck on with art on either side, 
Now dexterously her plumpers draws, 
That serve to fill her hollow jaws. 
Untwists a wire; and from her gums 
A set of teeth completely comes. 
Pulls out the rags contrived to prop 
Her flabby dugs and down they drop. 
Proceeding on, the lovely goddess 
Unlaces next her steel-ribbed bodice; 
Press down the lumps, the hollows fill, 
Up goes her hand, and off she slips 
The bolsters that supply her hips. 
With gentlest touch, she next explores 
Her shankers, issues, running sores, 
Effects of many a sad disaster; 
And then to each applies a plaister. 
But must, before she goes to bed, 
Rub off the dawbs of white and red; 
And smooth the furrows in her front 
She takes a bolus ere she sleeps; 
And then between two blankets creeps. 
With pains of love tormented lies; 
Or if she chance to close her eyes, 
Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams, 
And feels the lash, and faintly screams; 
Or, by a faithless bully drawn, 
At some hedge-tavern lies in pawn; 
Or to Jamaica seems transported, 
Alone, and by no planter courted; 
Surrounded with a hundred stinks, 
Belated, seems on watch to lie, 
And snap some cully passing by; 
Or, struck with fear, her fancy runs 
On watchmen, constables and duns, 
From whom she meets with frequent rubs; 
But, never from religious clubs; 
Whose favor she is sure to find, 
Behold the ruins of the night! 
A wicked rat her plaster stole, 
Half eat, and dragged it to his hole. 
The crystal eye, alas, was missed; 
A pigeon picked her issue-peas; 
And Shock her tresses filled with fleas. 
But how shall I describe her arts 
To recollect the scattered parts? 
Or shew the anguish, toil, and pain, 
The bashful muse will never bear 
In such a scene to interfere. 
Corinna in the morning dizened, 

Certain labels are impervious
to solvents, impermeable
as drawn bridges.
Adherents are bound
to bridge and tunnel
around

Tall buildings tip on casters
or are counter-
weighted
also by the lurid light of subways.
Dust gathers on the wainscoting.
She runs a hand around a column
marbled
with the spectral pain
of amputees
Containing decomposure
in dividing cells, abiding
effacement

engraved with dispelled words.
Concentric desire outspreads
her strained connectives:
dazed and diffused,
flecked like fake marble.

in a window, a shadow, a standard,

She rubs against the space between them,

know them better.
This ease-based knowledge replaced
by a longing spiral on a spinning disk
pushing outward from an empty center.

There was a graven image of Desire 
And by him Pain, whose body shone like fire, 
And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire. 
Walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire. 
The senses and the sorrows and the sins, 
Till lips and teeth bite in their sharp indenture, 
Followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins. 
Upon whose lock was written Peradventure.

Forth from Calais, at dawn of night, when sunset summer on autumn shone, 
Fared the steamer alert and loud through seas whence only the sun was gone: 
Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled, and bade man welcome: a dim sweet hour 
Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea, and heaven was fair as a field in flower, 
Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling world as with music: the star-bright air 
Made the face of the sea, if aught may make the face of the sea, more fair. 
Whence came change? Was the sweet night weary of rest? What anguish awoke in the dark? 
Sudden, sublime, the strong storm spake: we heard the thunders as hounds that bark. 
Lovelier if aught may be lovelier than stars, we saw the lightnings exalt the sky, 
Living and lustrous and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die. 
Heaven's own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire: 
Thunder on thunder exulted, rejoicing to live and to satiate the night's desire. 

And the night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free: 
And a rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea. 
All the weight of the wind bore down on it, freighted with death for fraught: 
And the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught. 
And madness fell on them laughing and leaping; and madness came on the wind: 
And the might and the light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of Ind. 
Such glory, such terror, such passion, as lighten and harrow the far fierce East, 
Rang, shone, spake, shuddered around us: the night was an altar with death for priest. 
The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man born free 
Was clothed with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea. 
As a wild steed ramps in rebellion, and rears till it swerves from a backward fall, 
The strong ship struggled and reared, and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff's wall. 
Stern and prow plunged under, alternate: a glimpse, a recoil, a breath, 
And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the throat of death. 
Three glad hours, and it seemed not an hour of supreme and supernal joy, 
Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird's heart in a boy. 
For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed, sublime 
As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time. 
The glory beholden of man in a vision, the music of light overheard, 
The rapture and radiance of battle, the life that abides in the fire of a word, 
In the midmost heaven enkindled, was manifest far on the face of the sea, 
And the rage in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free. 
Far eastward, clear of the covering of cloud, the sky laughed out into light 
From the rims of the storm to the sea's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and white. 
The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade 
From the cloud's black base to the black wave's brim rejoiced in the light they made. 
Far westward, throned in a silent sky, where life was in lustrous tune, 
Shone, sweeter and surer than morning or evening, the steadfast smile of the moon. 
The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold, and deep 
As life or as death, revealed and transfigured, may shine on the soul through sleep. 
All glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know 
Bore witness there to the soul of its likeness and kinship, above and below. 
The joys of the lightnings, the songs of the thunders, the strong sea's labour and rage, 
Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to wage. 
No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night made bare, 
Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea's, 
Rebellious, rapturous, and transient as faith or as terror that bows men's knees. 
No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams 
One utterly, mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides 
As the glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm, and released the tides. 
In the dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering, assailed and withheld 
As a soul born royal, if life or if death be against it, is thwarted and quelled. 
As the glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn 
Were the glories of flames phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn. 
A thousand Phosphors, a thousand Hespers, awoke in the churning sea, 
And the swift soft hiss of them living and dying was clear as a tune could be; 
As a tune that is played by the fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep, 
Audible alway alive in the storm, too fleet for a dream to keep: 
Too fleet, too sweet for a dream to recover and thought to remember awake: 
Light subtler and swifter than lightning, that whispers and laughs in the live storm's wake, 
In the wild bright wake of the storm, in the dense loud heart of the labouring hour, 
A harvest of stars by the storm's hand reaped, each fair as a star-shaped flower. 
And sudden and soft as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed 
When the light and the sound of it sank, and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed. 
The glory, the terror, the passion that made of the midnight a miracle, died, 
Not slain at a stroke, nor in gradual reluctance abated of power and of pride; 
With strong swift subsidence, awful as power that is wearied of power upon earth, 
As a God that were wearied of power upon heaven, and were fain of a new God's birth, 
The might of the night subsided: the tyranny kindled in darkness fell: 
And the sea and the sky put off them the rapture and radiance of heaven and of hell. 
The waters, heaving and hungering at heart, made way, and were wellnigh fain, 
For the ship that had fought them, and wrestled, and revelled in labour, to cease from her pain. 
And an end was made of it: only remembrance endures of the glad loud strife; 
And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not again in the passage of life. 

My Self. A living man is blind and drinks his drop. 
What matter if the ditches are impure? 
What matter if I live it all once more? 
Endure that toil of growing up; 
The ignominy of boyhood; the distress 
Of boyhood changing into man; 
The unfinished man and his pain 
Brought face to face with his own clumsiness; 

How in the name of Heaven can he escape 
That defiling and disfigured shape 
The mirror of malicious eyes 
Casts upon his eyes until at last 
He thinks that shape must be his shape? 
And what's the good of an escape 
If honour find him in the wintry blast? 

I am content to live it all again 
And yet again, if it be life to pitch 
Into the frog-spawn of a blind man's ditch, 
A blind man battering blind men; 
Or into that most fecund ditch of all, 
The folly that man does 
Or must suffer, if he woos 
A proud woman not kindred of his soul. 

I am content to follow to its source 
Every event in action or in thought; 
Measure the lot; forgive myself the lot! 
When such as I cast out remorse 
So great a sweetness flows into the breast 
We must laugh and we must sing, 
We are blest by everything, 
Everything we look upon is blest.

What is a home? A guarded space, 
Shall sit together, face to face, 

Where cushioned walls rise up between 
The common pain, and pad and screen 

Where Art may blossom strong and free, 
And every laden moment be 

And Past and Future, softly veiled 
Forgotten half, and unassailed 

While the luxurious Present weaves 
Broiders her garments, heaps her sheaves, 

Can it be this, the longed-for thing 
Unsheltered beggars, birds on wing, 

No. Art may bloom, and peace and bliss; 
But if there be no more than this, 

Dim image from far glory caught, 
The true home rises in our thought, 

Its lamps burn freely in the night, 
Their cheering and abounding light 

Each sweet and secret thing within 
A thankful breath, sent forth to win 

The few, they bask in closer heat; 
Life higher seems, the world more sweet, 

So the old miracle anew 
And crumbs apportioned for a few, 

Stand in the gusty hollows, still and white;
And shore-lines whiten, silent as a dream:
I hark for the bird, and all the hushed hills harken:
What carols, like the blazon of a king,
Ah, thus the gladness of the gods was sung,
When the first morning on the mountains sprang:
And now he shouts, and the world is young again!
How to find God upon these hungry ways;
When bird and beast could make a man their friend ;
Homesick on Earth, and homeless to the end;
When maidens white with dark eyes shy and bold,
Their voices fading silverly in depths of forests old.
Before the weird earth-hunger of these days,
Sing ever in the dark ethereal dawns;
These stormy souls, these men of Earth may hear.

Show me the snowy summits dim in air;
In valleys silent under moon and star:
The lofty cedars misty in the light,
High places where on quiet afternoon
Startles the cliff, and dies across the woodland to a dream.

And yet my heart goes with him out of sight!
Now in the grove, now on the hill, now on
the fading stream.

By dripping rocks, dark dwellings of the gnome,
Where hurrying waters dash their crests to foam.
Down silent hollows where the woodbine blows,
Up water-courses scented by the rose.
We two together lost in forest old.-
O souls that are weary and are heavy laden,
Here is the peace of God !

Lo! now the clamoring hours are on the way:
With sudden apprehension of the sun;
The filmy tops of delicate dim firs,
And on the river border blows,
Till the world ends, lead me on!
Flashing a glint of dew upon the ground,
He drops into a valley and is gone!

1.

Morning: the caged baby
sustains his fragile sleep.
The house is a husk against weather.
With the leaves fallen,
the tree makes a web on the window
and through it the world
lacks color or texture,
like stones in the pasture
seen from this distance.

This is what is done with pain:
ice on the wound,
as though to check an open vein
where the self pumps out of the self
would stop the second movement of the heart,
diastolic, inclusive:
to love is to siphon loss into that chamber.

2.

What does it mean when a woman says,
if she sits all day in the tub;
if she worries her life like a dog a rat;
if her husband seems familiar but abstract,

Spared grief, they are given dread
as they tend the frail on either side of them.
Even their marriage is another child,
grown rude and querulous
since death practiced on them and withdrew.

He asks of her only a little lie,
a pale copy drawn from the inked stone
where they loll beside the unicorn,
great lovers then, two strangers
joined by appetite:
She wants something crisp and permanent,
an iron shawl across the bed
where they are laced together,
the moon bleaching the house,

still spread on the kitchen table,
the list of endangered species.
How plain the animals are,
quaint, domestic,
but the names lift from the page:
Woundfin. Whooping Crane. Squawfish.
Black-footed Ferret. California Least Tern.

Dearest, the beast of Loch Ness, that shy,
broad-backed, two-headed creature,
may be a pair of whales or manatee,
male and female,
driven from their deep mud nest,
who cling to each other,
circling the surface of the lake.

WHAT was he doing, the great god Pan, 
Spreading ruin and scattering ban, 
Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat, 
And breaking the golden lilies afloat 

II. 
He tore out a reed, the great god Pan, 
The limpid water turbidly ran, 
And the broken lilies a-dying lay, 
And the dragon-fly had fled away, 

III. 
High on the shore sate the great god Pan, 
And hacked and hewed as a great god can, 
With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed, 
Till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed 

IV. 
He cut it short, did the great god Pan, 
Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man, 
Steadily from the outside ring, 
And notched the poor dry empty thing 

V. 
 This is the way,' laughed the great god Pan, 
 The only way, since gods began 
To make sweet music, they could succeed.' 
Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed, 

VI. 
Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan ! 
Blinding sweet, O great god Pan ! 
The sun on the hill forgot to die, 
And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly 

VII. 
Yet half a beast is the great god Pan, 
Making a poet out of a man : 
For the reed which grows nevermore again 

God love you
lost in the horde
on this Friday night,
500 men are moving up
& down from the bath
room to the bar.
Remove this desire
from the man I love.
Who has opened
of the sea to me.
See to it that
his wants are filled
on California street
Bestow on him lar-
gesse that allows him
peace in his loins.
Leave him not
to the moths.
Make him out a lion
so that all who see him
hero worship his
thick chest as I did
moving my mouth
over his back bringing
our hearts to heights
I never hike over
Let blond hair burn
on the back of his
neck, let no ache
screw his face
up in pain, his soul
Not heroin.
Rather fix these
hundred men as his
lovers & lift him
with the enormous bale
of their desire.

Put nothing down to distress the reader.
No barking dog.
No rustle in the place whispers belong
or photos of petals near collapse.
Erase oranges of confusing taste, a face
wrinkled or in pain,
a map with waterless rivers or water
without a bend,
still in darkness. Here, where mystery

beyond hope comes too near,
make a bright flight of leaves
descend, none to smear all our spotless
rivers. A map folds and unfolds, does not
bunch or wrinkle. Rainbows to last.
The First Endlessness of Eden.
This was the spot I was to start on, a leg
steps out of the lake,
a step falters instead into dashes that spread without prints onto the screaming bank.

Tiny bit of humanity,

And looking away,
Through the ceiling of the room, and beyond.
Can it be that already you are thinking of being a poet?

To grow up and be a banker
About being a poet.

Of the sweet pain of love
And the keen joy of living;
Through the eternal beauty.
They talk abracadabra
In an unknown tongue,
Each one fashioning for himself
A wordy world of shadow problems,
And as a self-imagined Atlas,
Groaning out incoherent complaints at his load.

And, probably, always will be.

Not to be a poet.

the argument here.

But I lay it down
before us:
because an ugly

played dead

its dubious cunning
was brought to an end
outside our door

by our brutal, beautiful

little dog.

So how do I say

about death or sadness

a few minutes ago

by its repellent

There is a land of pure delight 
Infinite day excludes the night, 

There everlasting spring abides, 
Death like a narrow sea divides 

Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood 
So to the Jews old Canaan stood, 

But timorous mortals start and shrink 
And linger shivering on the brink, 

Oh could we make our doubts remove, 
And see the Canaan that we love, 

Could we but climb where Moses stood 

I
That was I, you heard last night,
     When there rose no moon at all,
Nor, to pierce the strained and tight
     Tent of heaven, a planet small:
Life was dead and so was light.

Not a twinkle from the fly,
     Not a glimmer from the worm;
When the crickets stopped their cry,
     When the owls forbore a term,
You heard music; that was I.

Earth turned in her sleep with pain,
     Sultrily suspired for proof:
In at heaven and out again,
Bloodlike, some few drops of rain.

What they could my words expressed,
     O my love, my all, my one!
Singing helped the verses best,
     And when singing's best was done,
To my lute I left the rest.

               V
So wore night; the East was gray,
     White the broad-faced hemlock-flowers:
There would be another day;
     Ere its first of heavy hours
Found me, I had passed away.

What became of all the hopes,

Light last on the evening slopes,

Any star, the smallest one,

Oh how dark your villa was,
     Windows fast and obdurate!
How the garden grudged me grass
Ground its teeth to let me pass!

Men of England, wherefore plough
For the lords who lay ye low?
Wherefore weave with toil and care
The rich robes your tyrants wear?

Wherefore feed and clothe and save
From the cradle to the grave
Those ungrateful drones who would

Wherefore, Bees of England, forge
Many a weapon, chain, and scourge,
That these stingless drones may spoil
The forced produce of your toil?

Have ye leisure, comfort, calm,
Or what is it ye buy so dear
With your pain and with your fear?

The seed ye sow, another reaps;
The wealth ye find, another keeps;
The robes ye weave, another wears;
The arms ye forge, another bears.

In hall ye deck another dwells.
Why shake the chains ye wrought? Ye see
The steel ye tempered glance on ye.

With plough and spade and hoe and loom
Trace your grave and build your tomb
England be your Sepulchre.

brooch missing, somewhere, a man recoils at the absence
of his gambling stash. somewhere, a miser rifles
over a vanished ransom in newly minted silver

all this to buy a hotbed of memories
to feed the children fresh-killed lies
to open all the locks on love

forever is a moment we hold in our stomachs

as he brushes the smudge of his kiss
across my lips, i smell the cologne of his fear
a robust and smoky aroma mingled
with the woody musk of courtrooms and the stench of
pain-paved alleyways

i take these things and promise to say mum

The amities of morning 
in their intelligent wings; 

beating solitudinous rocks 

and murmurous 
and beating, of the mind 
as some half-forgotten name . . . 

the rain has withdrawn 
like the hard-to-believe- 
in days of our childhood. 

Light moves, the whole 
returning; 
the gouty rat and straggly 

root collaborate. Earth 
with the billowy sky 

is the field- 
the various fruits: 
road, a girl passionate 

like his once endless

the birds brimming fire- 

breath never balked, a many- 
membered bird-flight,

The eyes passing, 
contracted from night 

and war the stars 
and those eyes roam 

free as the Greeks: 
gleaming, there is home.

A bone shop, soaked in pearl, a dumping-
Ground for rarities, the sea-maws pumping

With unimaginable wealth, the spoil
Of deaf-mute drownings, the immemorial

The formal, hidden iceberg, slant, oblique

(A metaphysic harp from sky to heel)
Hang in the flesh that dangles from the creel

In spring, coil after coil, on moistened clay,
Though similar to the serpent wriggling away,
Are but facsimiles, though not quite dead.

Whose inching tape maneuvered in the sun
To measure every guilty length of Eden.

For pain or absence of it, marries love
Of one kind of another. In his grove,

Clutched in one hand, and the Sundy funnies spread

As soup, the mudflats where night crawlers came,
Tempted by the water tops to change the lame

Hot on our backs abnormal dryness, shadow
Forming in the seanets, seaweed into meadow,

Feathered and efficient, from tallest trees to stake
A claim so ravishing that now we undertake

Bespeak its ancient languages. The salt
Our tears and blood must harbor from its vault

She was in terrible pain the whole day,
as she had been for months: a slipped disc,
and there is nothing more painful. She

just beginning to make a name for her
nom de plume. As with most things in life,

it happened when she was changing channels
on her television. The lucky man, on the other
hand, was smiling for the first time

in his life, and it was fake. He was
an aspiring philosopher of dubious potential,
very serious, but somehow lacking in

essential depth. He could have been
an adequate undertaker. It was not the first
time for either of them. It was a civil

service, with no music, few flowers.
Still, there was a slow and erratic tide

And flashcubes, instant photos, some blurred
what they were meant to be. The bride slept

through much of it, and never did we figure out
who was on whose team. I think the groom

to arrive, nor the last to leave. Who knows,
it may all turn out for the best. And who

really cares about such special days, they
are not what we live for.

what god is about

It is portentous, and a thing of state 
That here at midnight, in our little town 
A mourning figure walks, and will not rest, 
Near the old court-house pacing up and down. 

Or by his homestead, or in shadowed yards 
He lingers where his children used to play, 
Or through the market, on the well-worn stones 
He stalks until the dawn-stars burn away. 

A bronzed, lank man! His suit of ancient black, 
A famous high top-hat and plain worn shawl 
Make him the quaint great figure that men love, 
The prairie-lawyer, master of us all. 

He cannot sleep upon his hillside now. 
And we who toss and lie awake for long 
Breathe deep, and start, to see him pass the door. 

His head is bowed. He thinks on men and kings. 
Yea, when the sick world cries, how can he sleep? 
Too many peasants fight, they know not why, 
Too many homesteads in black terror weep. 

The sins of all the war-lords burn his heart. 
He sees the dreadnaughts scouring every main. 
He carries on his shawl-wrapped shoulders now 
The bitterness, the folly and the pain. 

He cannot rest until a spirit-dawn 
The league of sober folk, the Workers' Earth, 
Bringing long peace to Cornland, Alp and Sea. 

It breaks his heart that kings must murder still, 
That all his hours of travail here for men 
That he may sleep upon his hill again?

Bethlehem in Germany,
Glitter on the sloping roofs,
Breadcrumbs on the windowsills,
Candles in the Christmas trees,
Hearths with pairs of empty shoes:
Panels of Nativity
Open paper scenes where doors
Open into other scenes,
Some recounted, some foretold.
Blizzard-sprinkled flakes of gold
Gleam from small interiors,
Picture-boxes in the stars
Open up like cupboard doors
In a cabinet Jesus built.

Southern German villagers,
Peasants in the mica frost,
See the comet streaming down,
Heavenly faces, each alone,
Faces lifted, startled, lost,
As if lightning lit the town.

Sitting in an upstairs window
Patiently the village scholar
Raises his nearsighted face,
Interrupted by the star.
Left and right his hands lie stricken
Useless on his heavy book.
When I lift the paper door
In the ceiling of his study
One canary-angel glimmers,
Flitting in the candelabra,
Peers and quizzes him: Rabbi,
What are the spheres surmounted by?
But his lips are motionless.
Child, what are you asking for?
Look, he gazes past the roofs,
Gazes where the bitter North,
Stretched across the empty place,
Opens door by door by door.

This is childhood's shrunken door.
When I touch the glittering crumbs,
When I cry to be admitted,
No one answers, no one comes.

And the tailor's needle flashes
In midair with thread pulled tight,
Stitching a baptismal gown.
But the gown, the seventh door,
Turns up an interior
Hidden from the tailor's eyes:
Baby presents like the boxes
Angels hold on streets and stairways,
Wooden soldier, wooden sword,
Chocolate coins in crinkled gold,
Hints of something bought and sold,
Hints of murder in the stars.
Baby's gown is sown with glitter
Spread across the tailor's lap.
Up above his painted ceiling
Baby mouse's skeleton
Crumbles in the mouse's trap.

Leaning from the cliff of heaven,
Indicating whom he weeps for,
Joseph lifts his lamp above
The infant like a candle-crown.
Let my fingers touch the silence
Where the infant's father cries.
Give me entrance to the village
From my childhood where the doorways
Open pictures in the skies.
But when all the doors are open,
No one sees that I've returned.
When I cry to be admitted,
No one answers, no one comes.
Clinging to my fingers only
Pain, like glitter bits adhering,
When I touch the shining crumbs.

Blood scissored down his chin.
myself and starving him. He knocked
me so my nose coughed blood,
punched a finger through my cornea.
Blood blubbed on my nipple
where his gums met. On the radio
somebody was saying something about Syria.
My son jerked knots of hair from my head,
him once against the doorjamb:
when we were younger, drinking harder,
made blood come then. Twice I tried to leave
him screaming, twenty minutes at a time,
One breakfast I broke the mug that insisted
Smashed it. And all the time
I smiled so much my teeth dried.
He made everything heavy.
Like they say the bomb did for a while,
so that Americans swam
through their homes, eyes peeled,
picking up everyday things and dropping them
as though they were violated with light and pain.

whose letters cease to arrive
aloft as a principle of life--

Oh you, the sprightliest & most puggish, the brightest star
Of all my lively loves, all Ladies, & to whom once I gave up
My heart entire, thenceforth yours to keep forever
To throw away, carelessly, at your leisure, should that prove
Your best pleasure, Who is that dumpy matron, decked out in worn &
Shabby army fatigues which pooch out both before & behind, now
And once more, even, fiercely pecking at me in the cold drab Parish
Who is that midget-witch who preens & prances as she flaunts her lost
& flapping, & who
Is shrieking even now these mean words:
at me, & croons, gleefully.
& She is claiming to be you
She brings out from inside that small purse, my withered heart; &
lifting it
high into the air over her head with her two hands, she turns it upside
unzips its fasteners, & shakes it out over the plywood floor, happily.
I watch her, and think,
Your ribbon I wear, your favor tied to the grip of my lance, when I

I carved upon my desk unsayables.
He drank until he vomited on himself.
Eavesdropping, the others resisted sleep.
The house knew the pain of sun on lacquered floorboards.

I carved it with the tips of scissors.
A door creaked; he hung his head into the room.
Please, the others cannot sleep.
The shingles twitched like skin beneath moonlight.

I spent the afternoon at a movie theater.
He staggered through brush toward a pay phone.
The others continued searching the streets for him.
The house held the moon above it, it was that imperial.

I recall the room was empty when I came back in.
He was arrested at the Quik-Trip while calling collect.
Frantic, the others circled the block again.
The house was ghost-white, older than the dead.

I needle-pointed for 72 hours straight.
He claimed the whole situation humiliated him.
Relieved, the others refrained from asking him what jail was like.
The house was swan to field, tiger to sea.

I lay in bed by the time the others came home.
He couldn't recall putting on the orange jumpsuit.
The others asked if I'd seen him around.

The house winced, winked its blinds.
The house whispered I should stay inside.
The others flew out the doors and into their cars.
The others slammed their cars into deer and cried.

He was more humiliated than he'd ever been.
He looked more or less the same, though his eyes were ringed.
The others hid in the basement.
He climbed the stairs and presented a ring.

The house swung its windows wide to ice.
He banged his nails blue, pinned his tongue to his tie.
He packed himself in a box, sent it to regions far off.
The others pressed their ears to the pipes.

The house called a radio talk-show.
We drank all night, laughed all night, the night he left.
I shook in its mouth till the house drank me up.

I
However the image enters
its force remains within
my eyes
learning to survive
where there is no food
my eyes are always hungry
and remembering
however the image enters
its force remains.
A white woman stands bereft and empty
recalled in me forever
etched into my visions
food for dragonfish that learn
to live upon whatever they must eat
fused images beneath my pain.

A Mississippi summer televised.
Trapped houses kneel like sinners in the rain
now awash
a tattered baby's blanket in her arms.
a microphone
thrust up against her flat bewildered words
caked around the edges
her pale eyes scanning the camera for help or explanation
unanswered
hanging upon her coat like mirrors
and that lie hangs in his mouth
like a shred of rotting meat.

I inherited Jackson, Mississippi.
on plump boy-cheeks
his only Mississippi summer
whistling a 21 gun salute to Dixie
in the midnight waters of the Pearl.

His broken body is the afterimage of my 21st year
when I walked through a northern summer
my eyes averted
the avid insistence of detail
pretending insight or information
the length of gash across the dead boy's loins
his gouged out eyes
louder than life
all over
bruise upon livid bruise
and wherever I looked that summer
I learned to be at home with children's blood
with savored violence
like a raped woman's face.

A black boy from Chicago
whistled on the streets of Jackson, Mississippi
testing what he'd been taught was a manly thing to do
his teachers
and flung him to the Pearl weighted with stone
in the name of white womanhood
they took their aroused honor
back to Jackson
the double ritual of white manhood
confirmed.

Emmett Till rides the crest of the Pearl, whistling
(what did she pay to never know its price?)
and I can withhold my pity and my bread.

with ancient and familiar sorrows
a woman surveying her crumpled future
never allowed her own tongue
without power or conclusion
unvoiced
and a man with an executioner's face
pulls her away.

Within my eyes
the flickering afterimages of a nightmare rain
a woman wrings her hands
beneath the weight of agonies remembered
betrayed by vision
hers and my own
the horrors we are living
with tortured lungs
adapting to breathe blood.

A woman measures her life's damage
my eyes are caves, chunks of etched rock
whistling
crying and frightened
and soundlessly
a woman begins to weep.

At a party I spy a handsome psychiatrist,
And wish, as we all do, to get her advice for free.
We learn that happiness is a Chinese meal,
While sorrow is a nourishment forever.
My new environment is California Dreamer.
And, Doctor, another thing has got me worried:
At home, I want to write a happy poem
On love, or a love poem of happiness.
The rub, the minor abrasions of any two
But in this chapter, tragedy belongs
To that other life, the old life before us.
Here is my aphorism of the day:
Happy people are monogamous.
Even in California. So how does the poem play
Without the paraphernalia of betrayal and loss?
My former husband, that old disaster, is now just funny,
So laugh we do, in what Cyril Connolly
Has called the endless, nocturnal conversation
Of marriage. Which may be the best part.
Darling, must I love you in light verse
Without the tribute of profoundest art?
Or I yours, by dying. I could weep over that.
But now it seems forced, here in these heaven hills,
The mourning doves mourning, the squirrels mating,
My old cat warm in my lap, here on our terrace
As from below comes a musical cursing
As you mend my favorite plate. Later of course
I could pick a fight; there is always material in that.
Who scream out red-hot iambs in their hate.
No, love, the heavy poem will have to come
From temps perdu, fertile with pain, or perhaps
Detonated by terrors far beyond this place
Where the world rends itself, and its tainted waters
Rise in the east to erode our safety here.
Much as I want to gather a lifetime thrift
And craft, my cunning skills tied in a knot for you,

As I reach to close each book
to snap at my fingers. My legs
My fingers pain me
at my touch.

their creases. I use books
almost apologetically. I believe
and get a smile, knowing
it is for the sake of politeness.
among the human race and yet
nothing is said at all
because of that.
But no book will help either.
I stroke my desk,
I set a typewriter on its surface
and begin to type
to tell myself my troubles.
Against the evidence, I live by choice.

I sing the man that never equal knew, 
Whose mighty arms all Asia did subdue, 
Whose conquests through the spacious world do ring, 
That city-raser, king-destroying king, 
And worthily the name of Great did gain. 
This is the prince (if fame you will believe, 
To ancient story any credit give.) 
Who when the globe of Earth he had subdued, 
With tears the easy victory pursued; 
Because that no more worlds there were to win, 
No further scene to act his glories in.

Featherweight lawn chair, cooler for a footrest,
and me a squatter on the landlord's dock
where baitstealers teased a thousand times a day
until rowdy boats and summer scared them deep.
Day and night I snoozed on the porch
beneath a filthy orbit of fanblades
to the opera of my neighbors fighting
and reconciling in the glow of stolen wattage.

I saw them swimming once. Maybe naked,
judging from their skittish talk, but the water
smeared their bodies' pale particulars.
It was just me and the Tickfaw River.
Me with the taste of a tin can in my mouth,
feeling no pain, lighting a cigarette backwards,
the Tickfaw tricking me closer and closer
with echoes and music out of nowhere.

Is it funny that I was too lit to notice
twenty-five orange yards of extension cord
stretching from my outlet, over the driveway shells,
to feed the hungry plug of their deep freezer?
Mother would have pitched a fit if she discovered

Says that America is for him a maximum-security prison

Like a boiling Jacuzzi full of ballpeen hammers, even then he feels

Of the thick satin quilt of America

or whether he is just spin doctoring a better grade,

It was not blood but money

And so I perish happily,

Would never speak in rhymed couplets,

And I look at the student with his acne and cell phone and phony ghetto clothes

And I remember what Marx said near the end of his life:

But how could he have imagined 100 channels of 24-hour cable
Or what kind of nightmare it might be

When each day you watch rivers of bright merchandise run past you
And you are floating in your pleasure boat upon this river

Even while others are drowning underneath you
And you see their faces twisting in the surface of the waters

And yet it seems to be your own hand
Which turns the volume higher?

But to whatever animal we ascribe these remains, it is certain such a one has existed in America, and that it has been the largest of all terrestrial beings. It should have sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited, and the atmosphere it breathed, from the imputation of impotence. . . .
I called for armour, rose, and did not reel.
But when I thought . . .

 THE STATES
For he can creep.
Whose doctor said his bipolar was pre-existing.
Smacked in the head by a steel cargo door,
hinges tied with a hamburger bag.
The day he blew up: a sucking silence, mouth of tar,
bump and rattle, caissons rolling.
The blacked-out school bus window is
scratched to read GHOST RECON. Street signs flash by,
to Andrews Air Force, wheelchair bus to Walter Reed.
Wounded when burning poppies, now afloat
The navigator slides along a wall:
Where the gazebo is a tank. Where the manhole covers a bomb.
Who apologize for shaving cuts. Skull plate,
They limp by drug dealers for their scoop
of Baskin-Robbins. Are told,
Who are saved, but die in dreams,
salute with a mechanical arm.

And the king, our godsbody, lies abed

The survey says all groups can make more money 
if they lose weight except black men...men of other colors 
and women of all colors have more gold, but black men 
are the summary of weight, a lead thick thing on the scales, 
meters spinning until they ring off the end of the numbering 
of accumulation, how things grow heavy, fish on the 
ends of lines that become whales, then prehistoric sea life 
beyond all memories, the billion days of human hands 
working, doing all the labor one can imagine, hands 
now the population of cactus leaves on a papyrus moon 
waiting for the fire, the notes from all their singing gone 
up into the salt breath of tears of children that dry, rise 
up to be the crystalline canopy of promises, the infinite 
gone fishing days with the apologies for not being able to love 
anymore, gone down inside earth somewhere where 
women make no demands, have fewer dreams of forever, 
these feet that marched and ran and got cut off, these hearts 
torn out of chests by nameless thieves, this thrashing 
until the chaff is gone out and black men know the gold 
of being the dead center of things, where pain is the gateway 
to Jerusalems, Bodhi trees, places for meditation and howling, 
keeping the weeping heads of gods in their eyes.

Love is no more.
It died as the mind dies: the pure desire
Relinquishing the blissful form it wore,
The ample joy and clarity expire.

Regret is vain.
Then do not grieve for what you would efface,
The sudden failure of the past, the pain
Of its unwilling change, and the disgrace.

Leave innocence,
And modify your nature by the grief
Which poses to the will indifference
That no desire is permanent in sense.

Take leave of me.
What recompense, or pity, or deceit
Can cure, or what assumed serenity
Conceal the mortal loss which we repeat?

The mind will change, and change shall be relief.

Slip-pilings on the Brooklyn littoral
with its walledup doors wan doorshapes
on eroded sills. Downstream, the strutwork
of the Williamsburg cable tower
threw its cool shadow half a mile inland
over tarpaper seams, gantried water butts,
and splintery tenement cornices milled
with acanthus and classical grasses
of nineteenth-century dream-slum fantasy.
We could see, from our rooftops, the endspan
floating its ant-threads of traffic
to the granite salients of the anchorage,
and through its strands on the west

with chimerical figures and blueprints,

was running out, with its open evenings
and windows. One Saturday, turning onto my block
from the subway, I heard my name, crossed
the street where twin buildings had area-ways.
and saw you waving, the same, Pilar,
from a window below the swag-bellied area railings.
I walked down the building-side, and turned in a trash-littered
airwell by a door with multiple doorbells.
You opened from a wooden hallway, unpainted,
for illegals. They took out an inside wall, so our room
was the building front, the three others
drywall. On the bureau, a black-shawled

and a polychrome Madonna with meeting brows.

I tried to add something else at once, to leave this less ...
definitive, but nothing came, so we ran through bridge-rumors,
and soon we were hardly listening, waiting
for our own next word, and laughing at our gabble. Pequita
told us what the priest had said
First Communion, and none of us could stop
finding striking things to say. Next day you came over
to see my plants, and I came back for soup-supper, looking up
at my windows, which in the easy half-yellow light
of autumn looked oddly beckoning. As we ate,
and mockingly proposed that we three walk across the bridge,
had you listened to our committee?) And when I got home
I looked down, and through your sheer curtains saw you
cleaning up, and Pequita, at the table, reading.

But next week, instead of the plank stair
that zigzags up the anchorage-side, we wandered
the riverside shipping alleys. From below, we could see
overhead the under-arch of the bridge, and feel
the resonant top-thrum of westbound
this part. A sort of post-industrial fenworld, with tiny
terrace houses, big dredger-parts laid aside
filled with sea-floor light and trembling, long-awned
panicles of switchgrass. Its timelessness
tuckpointed facade, and a pair of brandnew bronze
Edwardian mermaid doorknockers. I could see
discount chains, tentative boutiques,
and mother and daughter figuring, to the upscale
with strange literalness among them, supplying
their just-permissible quantum of urban grit.

You were ahead, and Pequita trailed us, rattling weed stalks
with a stray lath. As we progressed in and out
green puddles, to a broken-off building wall. It had been
plaster squares trailing sawn pipes, with one high trembling
toilet, like a pearl. In a lower square, fringed
with ailanthus and barbs of gang graffiti,
was a mural. Muy latino: the mountain
dreaming the city: a terrace cafe with palm trees
and a dancer shawled in black lace, with inward-angled
castanets. And you lifted yourself on tiptoe,
Pilar, to touch the lace, as you might have grazed
sturdy inside your sturdy body, not this gesture
back, museum-wise, to contemplate, and you said:
pointed out more wall palms, beaches, until New York
seemed a dot in a belt of capitals
high on the globe: world-cities, packed
with immigrants, refugees, Gastarbeiter: a snowy
latitude suffused with tropical nostalgia.

We were a threesome. Coffee, suppers, TV,
or sleeping on my sofa, one bad month
they moved you to night shift. Yet only that summer,
in a lamplit bay, the night filled with myriad noises,
tenement-faces, florid, all bucrania, meanders, dusky trails
of fire-escape bedding. And everything underlit
by the sinister, slow-stopping car lights of our street.

But now it was the dailiness of two
from another hemisphere. Through snow-fissures, winds fluting
on railings and building-flaws, Pilar in her low frame
paced with armfuls of laundry, washed
in the sink and hung to dry everywhere. The thousand
stratagems of those who simply must not spend;
and the tiny mother-decisions: though you preferred
periphery, housekeeping around her,
you up on the sofa when you had flu, and bring you
I saw too, that of what I wanted the university

with one of the tiny cats of Rome, he leaped 
on my arm and half hung on to the food and half 
hung on to my shirt and coat. I tore it apart 
and let him have his portion, I think I lifted him 
down, sandwich and all, on the sidewalk and sat 
with my own sandwich beside him, maybe I petted 
his bony head and felt him shiver. I have 
told this story over and over; some things 
root in the mind; his boldness, of course, was frightening 
drove him mad. It was the breaking of boundaries, 
the sudden invasion, but not only that it was 
the sharing of food and the sharing of space; he didn't 
run into an alley or into a cellar, 
he sat beside me, eating, and I didn't run 
into a trattoria, say, shaking, 
with food on my lips and blood on my cheek, sobbing; 
but not only that, I had gone there to eat 
and wait for someone. I had maybe an hour 
before she would come and I was full of hope 
and excitement. I have resisted for years 
interpreting this, but now I think I was given 
a clue, or I was giving myself a clue, 
across the street from the glass sandwich shop. 
That was my last night with her, the next day 
I would leave on the train for Paris and she would 
meet her husband. Thirty-five years ago 
I ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms, we were 
dying together; we never met again 
a daughter or son somewhere, darling grandchildren 
in Norwich, Connecticut, or Canton, Ohio. 
Every five years I think about her again 
and plan on looking her up. The last time 
I was sitting in New Brunswick, New Jersey, 
and heard that her husband was teaching at Princeton, 
if she was still married, or still alive, and tried 
calling. I went that far. We lived 
in Florence and Rome. We rowed in the bay of Naples 
and floated, naked, on the boards. I started 
to think of her again today. I still 
am horrified by the cat's hunger. I still 
am puzzled by the connection. This is another 
insane devotion, there must be hundreds, although 
it isn't just that, there is no pain, and the thought 
is fleeting and sweet. I think it's my own dumb boyhood, 
walking around with Slavic cheeks and burning 
stupid eyes. I think I gave the cat 
half of my sandwich to buy my life, I think 
I broke it in half as a decent sacrifice. 
It was this I bought, the red coleus, 
the split rocking chair, the silk lampshade. 
Happiness. I watched him with pleasure. 
I bought memory. I could have lost it. 
How crazy it sounds. His face twisted with cunning. 
The wind blowing through his hair. His jaw working.

the bruise will stop by later.
For now, the pain pauses in its round,
leaves a memo for the surrogate: What the hell
did you think you were doing? I mean . . .
Oh well, less said the better, they all say.

God will find the pattern and break it.

I thank you for breaking the cycle, withstanding the enormity

Thank you to the policeman who took all the men whose safety

all the world to blame.

Thank you for picking up the handless, footless doll

and wait, patiently.

It is cold enough for rain
to coagulate and fall in heavy drops.
Tonight a skin of ice will grow
over the bones of the smallest bush,

making it droop like the wrist
of someone carrying a heavy suitcase. This moving on,
from season to season, is exhausting
and violent, the break from the Berlin Wall

of winter especially. Like a frostbitten
hand coming to life, I color
first with warmth,
then with pain. Thawing, letting

the great powers go
their own way, in rivers and in flesh,
frightens me, as this day
warns me of an icy night.

2.
Each year I am astonished
at the havoc wrought
on other lives: fathers
made tiny by cancer;

a mother swollen around
a bad heart "brought on by aggravation."
To suffer is to do something new

a change of life
wish they were men, some men
wish they were dead; still,

there is coin in suffering . . .
It makes us rich
as Croesus in his golden tears,
and we are rarely hated for it.

This coin I store in a purse
made of my mother's
milk and flesh, which God says I must not mix.
I use it instead to seek pleasure.

Walking around with this thing in me
all day, this loving cup
full of jelly, waiting for you

eight o'clock, eight-thirty . . .
What could be more important
than love? I can't imagine; you can.
Not a good day, not about to get better.

Air the same sweet
temperature inside the house
as outside the house.
Stepping up from the cellar

with an armful of sheets,
I listen for the dirge of flies
under the chittering birds,
both painfully loud. There is a stridency

that's stubborn in a life
grown by inches: the fat
little fingers of buds bursting;
ugly ducklings; the slow war

of day against night.
As I pin the swelling sheets
with clothespins damp and too
narrow at the mouth, I wonder how

flies know to come out
to feed the birds, and feast themselves
on the new stillborn, this stubborn
great chain of being.

But leave me a little love, 
A voice to speak to me in the day end, 
A hand to touch me in the dark room 
Breaking the long loneliness. 
In the dusk of day-shapes 
Blurring the sunset, 
One little wandering, western star 
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow. 
Let me go to the window, 
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk 
And wait and know the coming 
Of a little love.

O Hesper-Phosphor, far away
That moan of an ancient agony
From purple forest to golden sky
It is not the wind that wakes with the day;
Catching the sun-dawn on their wings,
Flutter and fall in airy rings;

With tears? Is not the voice of all regret
We that remember our lost Arcady,
Have we not known, we too,
The radiant clouds at sunrise curled
Around the brows of the golden world;
The marble temples, washed with dew,
To which with rosy limbs aflame
The violet-eyed Thalassian came,
Came pitiless, only to display
How soon the youthful splendour dies away;
Laughing across the gray-grown bitter sea?
And though the years bring more than aught they take,
Yet might his heart and hers well break
Remembering how one prayer must still be vain,
With those first loves that never come again.

How many, how many generations,
When the dark earth yearns to the unforgotten nations
Old loves, old lovers, wonderful and unnumbered

From the beautiful palaces, from the miraculous portals,
They were taintless of dust, the proud, the peerless Immortals
Perchance they are there, earth dreams, on the shores of Hesper,

Do they sing together, perchance, in that diamond splendour,
With eyelids twitching to tears and with eyes grown tender,
The songs of Greece? Ah, with harp-strings mute do they falter
When the heroes launch their ship by the smoking altar
Far, far away, do their hearts resume the story
When all those urgent oars on the waste of glory

But where His desolation trod

In Barcelona, Jew; in Paris, Arab: 
Everywhere and at all times, and he fights back. 

He holds up seven thick little fingers 
In the flat brown eyes flecked with blood. 

He asks me to tell all I can remember 
In North Africa and what came after, 
The loss of his father, the loss of his brother, 

Dusted with glass, the warm smell of rye 
So strong he ate till his mouth filled with blood. 

Tells me I should never disparage 
The stiff bristles that guard the head of the fighter. 

Stiff, 116 pounds, five feet two, 

Kisses my lips, his eyes still open, 
My imaginary brother, my cousin, 
Myself made otherwise by all his pain.

We burrowed night and day with tools of lead,
Heaped the bank up and cast it in a ring
And hurled the earth above. And Caesar said,
"Why, it is excellent. I like the thing."
We, who are dead,
Made it, and wrought, and Caesar liked the thing.

And here we strove, and here we felt each vein
Ice-bound, each limb fast-frozen, all night long.
And here we held communion with the rain
That lashed us into manhood with its thong,
Cleansing through pain.
And the wind visited us and made us strong.

Up from around us, numbers without name,
Strong men and naked, vast, on either hand
Pressing us in, they came. And the wind came
And bitter rain, turning grey all the land.
That was our game,
To fight with men and storms, and it was grand.

For many days we fought them, and our sweat
Watered the grass, making it spring up green,
Blooming for us. And, if the wind was wet,
Our blood wetted the wind, making it keen
With the hatred
And wrath and courage that our blood had been.

So, fighting men and winds and tempests, hot
With joy and hate and battle-lust, we fell
Where we fought. And God said, "Killed at last then? What!
Ye that are too strong for heaven, too clean for hell,
(God said) stir not.
This be your heaven, or, if ye will, your hell."

So again we fight and wrestle, and again
Hurl the earth up and cast it in a ring.
But when the wind comes up, driving the rain
(Each rain-drop a fiery steed), and the mists rolling
Up from the plain,
This wild procession, this impetuous thing.

Hold us amazed. We mount the wind-cars, then
Whip up the steeds and drive through all the world,
Searching to find somewhere some brethren,
Sons of the winds and waters of the world.
We, who were men,
Have sought, and found no men in all this world.

Wind, that has blown here always ceaselessly,
Bringing, if any man can understand,
Might to the mighty, freedom to the free;
Wind, that has caught us, cleansed us, made us grand,
Wind that is we

That so may live and wrestle and hate that when
They fall at last exultant, as we fell,
And come to God, God may say, "Do you come then
Mildly enquiring, is it heaven or hell?
Why! Ye were men!
Back to your winds and rains. Be these your heaven and hell!"

I called Hart on my longer distance line
Hart, I implored, I searched your book
(Yes, you have a Collected) and could fine
Nothing about the 36 cast iron bridges in
At least. He said he wrote about the narrow Bow Bridge
For peds built in 1878 which is sad and fine
And always photographed through branches in the foregrine
Which was sufficiently sad to make him weep all the tine
He was trying to write the poem so he threw it away.
He tried again and he uncontrollably wept agine.
Did you try a third tine,
Life is uncontrollably sad all the time
Unless we divert ourselves with art objects,
About this, for instance when we feel it
While looking at a photograph of the cast ine
Bow Bridge or see in life not photos but the real bridge at a short destine
Away with the actual park and branches around us,
We feel like killing ourselves to stop the pain
Or as you, Arthur, call it, the pine,
To write the poem. Get off this line,

Well, I considered calling on my second longer distance line
Kenneth who in heavine has changed his name to Kenneth Kine
And Barbara who I did call on my second longer distance line
With Hart on hold and affirmed her name change to Barbara Gine
Or whether they had discarded their own poems about the 36 cast ine
Bridges for people to walk on in Central Park
Because they were weeping on the paper and pine
I figured the next step was mine.
So if you can believe it I hung up on Hart Crine.

The sun is high, the seaside air is sharp, 
And salty light reveals the Mayan School. 
The Irish hope their names are on the harp, 
We see the sheep's advertisement for wool, 
Boulders are here, to throw against a tarp, 
From which comes bursting forth a puzzled mule. 
Perceval seizes it and mounts it, then 
The blood-dimmed tide recedes and then comes in again. 

Fateful connections that we make to things 
Whose functioning's oblivious to our lives! 
How sidewise news of light from darkness springs, 
How blue bees buzz from big blooms back to hives 
And make the honey while the queen bee sings 
How long ago I saw the misted pine trees 
And hoped, no matter how, to get them into poetry! 

Stendhal, at fifty, gazing as it happened 
On Rome from the Janiculum, decided 
That one way he could give his life a stipend 
Was to suspend his being Amour's fighter 
And get to know himself. Here he had ripened 
Accomplished, loved, and lived, was a great writer 
But never had explored in true detail 
His childhood and his growing up. So he set sail 

Composing La Vie de Henry Brulard 
But in five hundred pages scarcely got 
Beyond his seventeenth year, for it is hard 
To take into account what happens here 
And fit it all onto an index card. 
Even one moment of it is too hot, 
Complex and cannibalistically connected 
To every other, which is what might be expected. 

Sterne's hero has a greater problem, never 
Getting much past his birth. I've had a third one. 
My autobiography, if I should ever 
Start out to write it, quickly seems a burden 
An I-will-do-that-the-next-time endeavor. 
Whatever life I do write's an absurd one 
As if some crazy person with a knife 
Cut up and made a jigsaw puzzle of a life. 

In any case a life that's hardly possible 
In the conditions that we really live in, 
Where easy flying leaps to inaccessible 
Mountainy places where love is a given 
And misery, if there, infinitesimal, 
Are quite the norm. Here none by pain is driven 
That is not curable by the romanza 
That's kept in readiness to finish any stanza. 

Whatever, then, I see at this late stage of 
My life I may or may not have stayed ignorant 
Of that great book I've strained to write one page of 
Yet always hoping my page was significant. 
Be it or not, for me and for the ages 
I leave it as it is. Yet as a figurant 
Who has not stopped, I'm writing in addition 
More lines to clarify my present disposition. 

One person in a million finds out something 
Perhaps each fifty years and that is knowledge. 
Newton, Copernicus, Einstein are cunning. 
The rest of us just rise and go to college 
With no more hope to come home with the bunting 
Than a stray dachshund going through the village. 
However, what a treat our small successes 
Of present and of past, at various addresses! 

To be in all those places where I tarried 
Too little or too late or bright and early 
To love again the first woman I married 
To marvel at such things as melancholy, 
Sophistication, drums, a baby carriage, 
How my desire when young to be a poet 
Made me attentive and oblivious every moment! 

Do you remember Oceanview the Fair? 
The heights above the river? The canoes? 
The place we beached them and the grass was bare? 
Those days the sandbars gave our knees a truce? 
The crooked line of pantry shelves, with pear 
And cherry jam? And Pancho, with his noose? 
Do you remember Full and Half and Empty? 
Do you remember sorrow standing in the entry? 

Do you remember thought, and talking plainly? 
Michel and I went walking after Chartres 
Cathedral had engaged our spirits mainly 
By giving us an insight into Barthes. 
Michel said he was capable of feigning 
Renewed intentions of the soul's deep part, 
Like this cathedral's artificial forces 
That press a kind of artless thought into our faces. 

The porcupine turns over on its belly 
And new conceptions rap at the cocoon. 
Civilization, dealing with us fairly, 
For once, releases its Erectheion 
Of understanding, which consoles us, nearly. 
Later we study certain characteristics 
That may give us a better chance with the statistics. 

How much I'd like to live the whole thing over, 
But making some corrections as I go! 
To be a better husband and a father, 
Be with my babies on a sled in snow. 
By twenty I'd have understood my mother 
And by compassion found a way to know 
What separates the what-I-started-out-as 
From what-I-sometimes-wished-I-was-when-in-the-mountains. 

To be once more the one who what was worthy 
As trying to, er, as they say, give birth to 
A poem and as often unsuccessful, 
But it was nice to be sublime and flirty 
With radiant girls, and, in some strange way, restful. 
And then to get somebody else to feel it mutually! 

In poems the same problem or a similar. 
Desire of course not only to do old things 
But things unheard of yet by nuns or visitors 
And of the melancholy finch be co-finch 
In singing songs with such a broad parameter 
That seamstresses would stare, forget to sew things, 
Astronauts quit the sky, athletes the stadium 
To hear them, and the rest of what they hear be tedium. 

Such wild desires, I think it's recognizable 
Are part and parcel of the Human Image 
And in a way, I'd say, no less predictable 
Than Popeye's feelings for a can of spinach. 
Yet if we're set on course by the Invisible, 
All pre-determined, what about the language 
That teases me each morning with its leanings 
Toward the Unprogrammed Altitudes beyond its meanings? 

Are you, O particles, O atoms, nominatives 
Like Percevals and Stendhals, set in motion 
By some Ordaining Will that is definitive? 
Is this invading chill and high emotion, 
This tendency to know one is regenerative, 
Is this, all, tidal take-home like the ocean? 
Be what you may, my thanks for your society 
Through the long life I've had, your jokes and your variety, 

The warmth you've shown in giving me a temperature 
That I can live with, and the strength you've shared with me 
What can I say? It is as if life stared at me 
And kissed my lips and left it as a signature. 
Thank you for that, and thank you for preparing me 
For love itself, and friendship, its co-agent. 
Thank you for being this, and for its inspiration.

You are a friend then, as I make it out, 
Of our man Shakespeare, who alone of us 
Will put an ass's head in Fairyland 
As he would add a shilling to more shillings, 
Miraculous inviolable increase 
Fills Ilion, Rome, or any town you like 
Of olden time with timeless Englishmen; 
All you down there where your small Avon flows 
By Stratford, and where you're an Alderman. 
Some, for a guess, would have him riding back 
To be a farrier there, or say a dyer; 
Or maybe one of your adept surveyors; 
Or like enough the wizard of all tanners. 
The nimble element, the true caloric; 
I see it, and was told of it, moreover, 
By our discriminate friend himself, no other. 
Had you been one of the sad average, 
The sinew and the solvent of our Island, 
You'd not be buying beer for this Terpander's 
Approved and estimated friend Ben Jonson; 
He'd never foist it as a part of his 
Contingent entertainment of a townsman 
While he goes off rehearsing, as he must, 
If he shall ever be the Duke of Stratford. 
Far from it; for one town's as like another 
And there's the Stratford in him; he denies it, 
And there's the Shakespeare in him. So, God help him! 
I tell him he needs Greek; but neither God 
Nor Greek will help him. Nothing will help that man. 
You see the fates have given him so much, 
Of London, where he sees too many lords. 
They're part of half what ails him: I suppose 
There's nothing fouler down among the demons 
Than what it is he feels when he remembers 
The dust and sweat and ointment of his calling 
With his lords looking on and laughing at him. 
King as he is, he can't be king de facto, 
And that's as well, because he wouldn't like it; 
He'd frame a lower rating of men then 
Than he has now; and after that would come 
An abdication or an apoplexy. 
Though half the world, if not the whole of it, 
May crown him with a crown that fits no king 
Save Lord Apollo's homesick emissary: 
Not there on Avon, or on any stream 
Where Naiads and their white arms are no more, 
Shall he find home again. It's all too bad. 
The best you ever saw; and he'll be there 
Anon, as you're an Alderman. Good God! 
He makes me lie awake o'nights and laugh. 

And you have known him from his origin, 
You tell me; and a most uncommon urchin 
A trifle terrifying, I dare say, 
Discovering a world with his man's eyes, 
Quite as another lad might see some finches, 
If he looked hard and had an eye for nature. 
But this one had his eyes and their foretelling, 
And he had you to fare with, and what else? 
As a boy should, I venture; and the dog, 
Most likely, was the only man who knew him. 
A dog, for all I know, is what he needs 
As much as anything right here to-day, 
To counsel him about his disillusions, 
A dog of orders, an emeritus, 
To wag his tail at him when he comes home, 
And then to put his paws up on his knees 
And say, "For God's sake, what's it all about?" 

Or what he needs. I tell him he needs Greek; 
I'll talk of rules and Aristotle with him, 
And if his tongue's at home he'll say to that, 
I have your word that Aristotle knows, 
And you mine that I don't know Aristotle." 
He's all at odds with all the unities, 
And what's yet worse, it doesn't seem to matter; 
He treads along through Time's old wilderness 
As if the tramp of all the centuries 
And that's a pity, or I say it is. 
Going his way, the way that he goes best, 
A pleasant animal with no great noise 
Save only divers and inclement devils 
Have made of late his heart their dwelling place. 
A flame half ready to fly out sometimes 
At some annoyance may be fanned up in him, 
But soon it falls, and when it falls goes out; 
He knows how little room there is in there 
For crude and futile animosities, 
And how much for the joy of being whole, 
And how much for long sorrow and old pain. 
On our side there are some who may be given 
To grow old wondering what he thinks of us 
And some above us, who are, in his eyes, 
Yet here we smile, or disappoint the gods 
Who made it so: the gods have always eyes 
To see men scratch; and they see one down here 
Who itches, manor-bitten to the bone, 
The lord of more than England and of more 
Than all the seas of England in all time 
Shall ever wash. D'ye wonder that I laugh? 
He sees me, and he doesn't seem to care; 
And why the devil should he? I can't tell you. 

I'll meet him out alone of a bright Sunday, 
Trim, rather spruce, and quite the gentleman. 
"What ho, my lord!" say I. He doesn't hear me; 
Wherefore I have to pause and look at him. 
He's not enormous, but one looks at him. 
A little on the round if you insist, 
For now, God save the mark, he's growing old; 
He's five and forty, and to hear him talk 
These days you'd call him eighty; then you'd add 
More years to that. He's old enough to be 
The father of a world, and so he is. 
"Ben, you're a scholar, what's the time of day?" 
Says he; and there shines out of him again 
Half-mad serenity that laughs at fame 
For being won so easy, and at friends 
Who laugh at him for what he wants the most, 
By which you see we're all a little jealous ... 
 Poor Greene! I fear the color of his name 
Was even as that of his ascending soul; 
Some scrivening to the end against their fate, 
Their puppets all in ink and all to die there; 
And some with hands that once would shade an eye 
Will reach by this time for a pot-house mop 
To slush their first and last of royalties. 
Poor devils! and they all play to his hand; 
For so it was in Athens and old Rome. 
But that's not here or there; I've wandered off. 
Greene does it, or I'm careful. Where's that boy? 

Yes, he'll go back to Stratford. And we'll miss him? 
Dear sir, there'll be no London here without him. 
We'll all be riding, one of these fine days, 
And then we'll think of what he never said 
With what he did say, would buy many horses. 
Though nowadays he's not so much for women: 
"So few of them," he says, "are worth the guessing." 
But there's a worm at work when he says that, 
And while he says it one feels in the air 
A deal of circumambient hocus-pocus. 
They've had him dancing till his toes were tender, 
And he can feel 'em now, come chilly rains. 
There's no long cry for going into it, 
However, and we don't know much about it. 
But you in Stratford, like most here in London, 
Have more now in the Sonnets than you paid for; 
He's put one there with all her poison on, 
To make a singing fiction of a shadow 
That's in his life a fact, and always will be. 
But she's no care of ours, though Time, I fear, 
Will have a more reverberant ado 
About her than about another one 
Who seems to have decoyed him, married him, 
With much already learned, and more to learn, 
And more to follow. Lord! how I see him now, 
Pretending, maybe trying, to be like us. 
Whatever he may have meant, we never had him; 
We'd flayed another had he tried it on us) 
That made as many of us as had wits 
More fond of all his easy distances 
Than one another's noise and clap-your-shoulder. 
But think you not, my friend, he'd never talk! 
Thereby acquiring much we knew before 
About ourselves, and hitherto had held 
Irrelevant, or not prime to the purpose. 
And there were some, of course, and there be now, 
Disordered and reduced amazedly 
I was young once, at least, if not beautiful.
And what is beauty anyway? The light off snow
is pretty. I was young once, as young as any.
After all, she thought, to know the edge
of truth or of mountains, you need to lie or fall.

Everyone has an inner life, O careless love,
it's as simple as that. That's why they hurried
She would avert her eyes from the magazines'
special issues with brides on their creamy covers.

He worked to replace her money he'd squandered.
Then came a time of last intimacy, her injections,
when once a week he'd puncture with the silken needle
her arm, her condition worse with age, her pain
made him wince and call her Dear; her alluring allergies.

From where they retired all views were distant,
nothing true or tender at hand. Mountains to the west
like pets kept for good weather or loneliness
and the need for cold to gloat upon.
They would sometimes think of history together,

of the choked passes which killed, of the grasses of summer
when water was rare and expensive as illicit love.
With the interstate smooth as needles gleaming beneath
the snow-slick peaks, they would think of pioneers
lost and together, alas, two by two, with beds as baggage.

Another edge to be cut on. She loves the little
line of houses or trees in landscapes, the thin
horizons hugely bearing the weight of drama
and of sky with its tooth of cypress or steeple.
And he, while he turned the wheel and tuned the radio,

what was on his married mind? He remembers often,
these latter days, the cousin he first loved,
her marriage to an ugly man when he lit the candles
and wore the little suit his mother made,
and he cried for her because she was only beautiful.

He remembered riding in the car from the library,
having taken a book on Freud because his cousin
was studying Freud, and such studies were forbidden
his Catholic childhood. And riding in the back seat
as his father drove he read about the fountain pen

as phallic, the ink seed of Onan spilled, and he
grew sick and felt the frisson of guilt and glory.
And she was married to an ugly man, but the world
conspires to avert its eyes, and the needle-sharp
peaks hover behind them as the little dashes of white

lines spurt out beneath their car on the highway home,
a little line like spoor marking their path, so easy
to retrace, ready made, like everyone's. So there's
no need to look, just live long, since youth is truer
than beauty, Love; long life and many children.
Three days I heard them grieve when I lay dead, 
(It was so strange to me that they should weep!) 
Tall candles burned about me in the dark, 
And a great crucifix was on my breast, 
And a great silence filled the lonesome room. 

I heard one whisper, "Lo! the dawn is breaking, 
And he has lost the wonder of the day." 
Another came whom I had loved on earth, 
And kissed my brow and brushed my dampened hair. 
Softly she spoke: "Oh that he should not see 
The April that his spirit bathed in! Birds 
Are singing in the orchard, and the grass 
That soon will cover him is growing green. 
The daisies whiten on the emerald hills, 
And the immortal magic that he loved 
Another said: "Last night I saw the moon 
Like a tremendous lantern shine in heaven, 
And I could only think of him-and sob. 
For I remembered evenings wonderful 
When he was faint with Life's sad loveliness, 
And watched the silver ribbons wandering far 
Along the shore, and out upon the sea. 
Oh, I remembered how he loved the world, 
The sighing ocean and the flaming stars, 

-His tapestries that wrap the earth's wide room. 
I minded me of mornings filled with rain 
When he would sit and listen to the sound 
As if it were lost music from the spheres. 
He loved the crocus and the hawthorn-hedge, 
He loved the shining gold of buttercups, 
And the low droning of the drowsy bees 
That boomed across the meadows. He was glad 
At dawn or sundown; glad when Autumn came 
With her worn livery and scarlet crown, 
And glad when Winter rocked the earth to rest. 
Strange that he sleeps today when Life is young, 
And the wild banners of the Spring are blowing 
With green inscriptions of the old delight." 

I heard them whisper in the quiet room. 
And tell them of the glory that was mine. 
There was no darkness where my spirit flew, 
There was no night beyond the teeming world. 
Their April was like winter where I roamed; 
Their flowers were like stones where now I fared. 
Earth's day! it was as if I had not known 
What sunlight meant! . . Yea, even as they grieved 
For all that I had lost in their pale place, 
I swung beyond the borders of the sky, 
And floated through the clouds, myself the air, 

Myself the ether, yet a matchless being 
Whom God had snatched from penury and pain 
To draw across the barricades of heaven. 
I clomb beyond the sun, beyond the moon; 
In flight on flight I touched the highest star; 
I plunged to regions where the Spring is born, 
Myself (I asked not how) the April wind, 
Myself the elements that are of God. 
Up flowery stairways of eternity 
I whirled in wonder and untrammeled joy, 
His dream that knows no end. . . . 
I was the dawn, I was the purple east, 
I was the moonlight on enchanted nights, 
(Yet time was lost to me); I was a flower 
For one to pluck who loved me; I was bliss, 
And rapture, splendid moments of delight; 
And I was prayer, and solitude, and hope; 
And always, always, always I was love. 
I tore asunder flimsy doors of time, 
And through the windows of my soul's new sight 
I saw beyond the ultimate bounds of space. 
The very moonbeam in that quiet room, 
The very sunlight one had dreamed I lost, 
The soul of the returning April grass, 
The spirit of the evening and the dawn, 
The perfume in unnumbered hawthorn-blooms. 
There was no shadow on my perfect peace, 
No knowledge that was hidden from my heart. 
I learned what music meant; I read the years; 
I found where rainbows hide, where tears begin; 
I trod the precincts of things yet unborn. 

Yea, while I found all wisdom (being dead), 
They grieved for me. . I should have grieved for them!

And mismatch,
Without a meaning, like air in its clear nothingness.
What can we say to either of them?
They ruffle our hair,
Then stop, abruptly as wind.
Nothing is endless but the sky.
The flies come back, and the afternoon
Teeters a bit on its green edges,
________
 

Those who look for the Lord will cry out in praise of him.
Some will go wordlessly, some
Will listen their way in with their mouths
And some will revile him out of love
Rows of gravestones stay our steps,
Bright as auras around our bodies.
And some will utter the words,
Hating their garments splotched by the flesh.
These are the lucky ones, the shelved ones, the twice-erased.

Dante and John Chrysostom
Clouds sculling downsky like a narrative for whatever comes,
Still lurking behind the stars,
In the landscape,
And handle our hurt with ease.
Sky blue, blue of infinity, blue
Why do the great stories always exist in the past?

Unanswerable questions, small talk,
Of evening,
Moon half-empty, moon half-full,
Spider at work between the hedges,
Last bird call,

We go to our graves with secondary affections,
Second-hand satisfaction, half-souled,
but we harbor no ill will.
What letters will we illuminate?
Above us, the atmosphere,
Above us, the great constellations sidle and wince,
The letters undarken and come forth,
Your X and my X.

Spirit of slides and silences,
Witness and walk on.
Succor my shift and save me ...
And in the gardens and dwarf orchard.
Under the rain,
The rain fills our narrow beds.

Hunched in the bath, four ibuprofen gulped
I am just a body bleeding in bad light.

But after an hour, as the wrenching wanes, 
I run more water in, remembering

In a palm of pinkish water, I scoop up 
red to nearly black as I tilt my hand
glistening like a ruby cabochon, 
would I harbor another life now?

Last spring, I sat above the harbor in Naples 
safely back at school. Palpable, 
soccer games in the Flegrean fields,
first words, whose honeyed gravity 

Their new principal refused to pay 
rabbits and a little clutch of chicks 
someone had written across the door in blood.
That bitch is going to get our children killed.

Fireworks seethed above the bobbing masts. 
One, drunker than the others, loomed

the hematite heaviness of a final no.

five months along, it was too late,

Blood on the sullen chair, the one that holds you with its pleasure

Blood inside the quartz, the beauty watch, the eye of the guard
Blood on the slope of names & the tattoos hidden

Blood on the Virgin, behind the veils,

Blood on the couch, made for viewing automobiles & face cream
Blood on the pin, this one going through you without any pain

Blood on the screen, the green torso queen of slavering hearts
Blood on the grandmother's wish, her tawdry stick of Texas

Blood on the daughter's breast who sews roses
Blood on the father, does anyone remember him, bluish?

Blood on the fender, in the sender's shoe, in his liquor sack
Blood on the street, call it Milagro Boulevard, Mercy Lanes
Blood on the alien, in the alligator jacket teen boy Juan

Blood driving miniature American queens stamped into rage
Blood driving rappers in Mercedes blackened & whitened in news

Distilled from evaporating brine, salt

But we do not hang ourselves in cowardice.

Sold six times on the journey to the coast,
once for a gun, then cloth, then iron
manilas, her pride was masticated like husks
of chewing sticks, spat from morning-rank mouths.

Breaking loose, edge of handcuffs held high
like the blade of a vengeful axe, she runs
across the salt scratch of deck,
pain deeper than the blue inside a flame.

The sound, like the break of bone
or the musket shot dropping her
over the side, her chains wrapped
around his neck in dance.

I met a courtier riding on the plain,
 Well-mounted on a brave and gallant steed;
 I sat upon a jade, and spurred to my pain 
 My lazy beast, whose tired sides did bleed:
 He saw my case, and then of courtesy
 Did rein his horse, and drew the bridle in,
 Because I did desire his company:
 But he corvetting way of me did win. 

Like newlyweds,
my parents slip out of their clothes.
He puts aside the sweater I chose
for him, she undoes her pearls.
They rise up from their old ailments,
their fears of falling, broken hips
and other bad news.
barefoot in their living room,
go bowling on a whim.
They garden all day without pain,
calling out like songbirds,
like dolls and their sleepless eyes
glide closed. They seem so eager
for morning, I pray they will find each other

Shoulders knobbed against  
a slat-backed chair,  
the temples tugged, a pull 

at the nape, you felt the up- 
sweep as she smoothed the fine  
wisps back and tucked 

yank into yank 
and a third into that  
until the consecutive 

dodges of thumbs and first  
fingers gathered,  
fraying and filing 

in an ornament that, suspended,  
looked ridiculous, even 

on a child who mostly  
set forth with  
what was called 

loose ends in order where  
others were not

others had of it

It made something there  
where there would have been 

a kind of face

woman like a duty,  
an obstinate  
duty to pattern. 

one thing rather  
than another, a wish 

suppressed, a vise that holds  
a thought in its proper 

place until it bobs  
to the surface 
of a generally balmy 

sea. Women and  
woman only a letter  

mixed, then mixed  
right out of the heaven

one kind of accident  
turns into another. 
The whole head throbs for days.

Tougher, coarser, split

The brushed-out waves

shadows, a thread  
inside the case, 

the case inside 
the locket, the locket  
beneath the yoke. 

All the effort  
to save in itself  
a form of loss. 

You can tell a story 
many ways. You can leave  
something out or put 

something in; you can fool  
yourself and hide.  
You can shake out 

the form or try 
to manage every wisp,  
but the latter will 

only bring you pain.  
You went under 
the hand and eye of another

be undone.

Rilke and George in hospital beds presumably, in Switzerland,
rested on white pillows 
all of it junk now, or no longer extant,
unattributable, anonymous
in its insentient and continual disintegration.

We bear within us the seeds of all the gods, 
who separated them, the words and things,
who blended them, the torments and the place where they come to an end, 
the few boards and the floods of tears,
home for a few wretched hours.

Can be no sorrow. Too distant, too remote, 
bed and tears too impalpable,
no No, no Yes,
birth and bodily pain and faith 
an undefinable surge, a lurch,
a power stirring in its sleep
sleep well!

Moonpoison, mullock of sacrifice,
Suffuses the veins of the eyes
Till the retina, mooncoloured,
Sees the sideways motion of the cretin crab
Hued thus like a tortoise askew in the glaucous moonscape
A flat hot boulder it
Lividly in the midst of the Doldrums
Sidles
The lunatic unable to bear the silent course of constellations
Mad and stark naked
Sidles
The obol on an eyeball of a man dead from elphantiasis
Sidles
All three across heaven with a rocking motion.
The Doldrums: 'region of calms and light baffling winds near Equator.'
But the calms are rare
The winds baffling but not light
And the drunken boats belonging to the Crab Club
Rock hot and naked to the dunning of the moon
All in the pallescent Sargasso weed
And windbound, seeking distraction by the light of deliverance
For
What are we but the excrement of non-existent noon?
What are we all but 'burial grounds abhorred by the moon'?
And did the Maoris die of measles? So do we.

But there is no snow here, nor lilies.
The night is glutinous
In a broad hearth crisscross thorn clumps
Smoulder: distant fireback of copse
Throws back silence: glassen ashes gleam in pond
The constellations which have stopped working (?)
Shimmer. No dead leaf jumps.
On edge of lawn a glowworm
Hangs out its state-recognized torchlamp
Blocks of flowers gape dumb as windows with blinds drawn
And in the centre the rugate trees
Though seeming as if they go up in smoke
Are held like cardboard where they are.
Bluehot it is queer fuel to make the moon move.

Agesias said: 'Nero was an artist because he murdered his mother
Sensibility (subliminal) is of more importance than moral obligation

Zeuxias said: 'What I have always been, I shall remain, a fool."
Epator was drunk for two days: Theodorus traced his disease to college,
And so down the Alphabet, ate, and the Persian,
With variegated gutterals and sibilants, the Gaelic with dipthongs and
Choctaw with three different clicks
Each letter is somebody
But the Crab is nobody
Nobody
Nobody
A ganglion of neurotic imitations
Composed of each letter in turn
Jointed by conflicts he does not want
A word that never existed with a sense nobody can understand.
Suffering for the sins his father refuse to commit
He sits and thinks about the twiddling toes of Gunerita
A boy-girl or girl-boy of an average pulchritude
Haunted by phantoms of his female self
Whom he has never seen but composed himself, thus:
This he desires, but despises:
Bhah!
Always sideways, crabs walk.

Either he is not fit for this world
Or this world not fit for him. But which?
After all this pain of development is there neither interval nor reward?
They lured him with promises,
Now it has all slipped sideways
What is the good, I ask you, of going into a melting-pot
If fated to melt again after getting out of it?
The answers are: He is not out of it
Determined to budge not from yon slippery rock
Not a yard, no, not an inch, no, nor a barleycorn's breadth
For chance is not blind but unimpedable
And we call it blind because
Since we frustrate it only by chance
We prefer to shut our own eyes.

The crab however crawls on.

He must therefore be a crab subnormal.
One day, one of his foreclaws, assembled as usual by many men,
Being longer than the other, turns and pinches his tentacles
With the other he pinches the persons that assembled the long one
Next day the short one, equally alien, is the longer
And the process is reversed.
In mass production one hand never knows
The evil the other is inspiring it to do
This is a heretic even to the faiths he fails to believe
So worthless, awkward, unintelligible,
The crab crawls on.

He has sufferd because he was ugly
Let him be cruel now that he is attractive
Caring not whether he fructifies cruelty or is merely hard on self.
We trap our goldfinch trapping out souls therewinged
Sacrifice our mad gods to the madder gods:
We hymn the two sons of Leda and Zeus Aegis-bearer
We don't. We drink and drivel. My

How can I be hardened when the whole world is fluid?
Corn blue-bloom-covered carpeting the wind
Wind humming like distant rooks
Distant rooks busy like factory whirring metal
Whirring metallic starlings bizarre like cogwheels missing teeth
These last grinning like the backs of old motor cars
Old motor cars smelling of tragomaschality
Tragomaschality denoting the triumph of self over civilization
Civilization being relative our to Greek
Chinese politely making borborygms to show satisfaction
Satisfaction a matter of capacity
Capacity not significance: otherwise with an epigram
Strabismus being as common spiritually as optically the moon
The moon tramping regular steps like a policeman past the houses of the
And the Zodiac itself, whirling and flaming sideways
Circling from no point returning through no point
Endlessly skidding as long as man skids, though never moving,

Is there nothing more soluble, more gaseous, more imperceptible?
Nothing.

For the gondolas cost too much, that year,
And the lit cross-beams, that year, in the Morosini,
Bright gods and Tuscan, back before dew was shed.
Light: and the first light, before ever dew was fallen.
Panisks, and from the oak, dryas,
Through all the wood, and the leaves are full of voices,
A-whisper, and the clouds bowe over the lake,
And there are gods upon them,
And in the water, the almond-white swimmers,
The silvery water glazes the upturned nipple,
Green veins in the turquoise,
Or, the gray steps lead up under the cedars.
My Cid rode up to Burgos,
Up to the studded gate between two towers,
Beat with his lance butt, and the child came out,
To the little gallery over the gate, between the towers,
Reading the writ, voce tinnula:
That no man speak to, feed, help Ruy Diaz,
On pain to have his heart out, set on a pike spike
And both his eyes torn out, and all his goods sequestered,
And he came down from Bivar, Myo Cid,
With no hawks left there on their perches,
And no clothes there in the presses,
And left his trunk with Raquel and Vidas,
That big box of sand, with the pawn-brokers,
To get pay for his menie;
Breaking his way to Valencia.
Ignez de Castro murdered, and a wall
Here stripped, here made to stand.
Drear waste, the pigment flakes from the stone,
Or plaster flakes, Mantegna painted the wall.

Supervises over the teatable our voluble hostess
The passing round of titterings and toasties.
Her glass-eyed friends, confidence's make-and-breaks,
Give each in series gobbets of another's cakes.
Dough drips into their tight triangular shoes.
Their mouths give vent to evil-smelling news
Keep their minds pure, make mental products crisper,
With speaking eyeball rolls and the not too improper whisper.
Fawn-eyed, the daughter, a gossip apprentice,
Festoons gilt malice on her unmalicious twenties.
Holiday smarmed the manureminded ephebus
Sees in every skirt lubricity's rebus.
To whom they genuflect whenever they enjoy their shocks.
A little of everything, is the note they strike,
The only limitation, what they think they do not like.
Always they suffer inexpressible injustices,
Making their own beds, these amateur Procrusteses,
But expect their maids to lie in them. The middle classes
Must have some defence against the vulgar masses.
They have no use for idle gossips that scarify:
But in their own leisure get together to verify
Rumours of rationalists, use of contraceptives,
Probable bastards, hope of their proving defectives
(Details being perquisites of good detectives).
This of course for the parish's sake. These long nose weevils
Seek knowledge of others', as expression of their own, evils:
And naught escapes being twisted and messed,
Their own souls included, on matters of interest.
Ignorant, superficial, malignant, self-deceived,
Ashamed to bear, but proud to be bereaved,
Lip-honouring peace, by their indignant whispers
Others they desecrate, their own insure, in their smug vespers.
At mattins for their own sins pray to be forgiven,
Revelling in others while walking home from heaven.
Martrylike suffer for transgressions of the parish,
Or say they do, particularly the most garish.
But humbly at their bedside never hope that Jesus has destroyed
Others' misfortunes wholly, lest themselves be unemployed.
Such and so balsting are their faded Joys
Which Time, nor Sickness, never quite destroys.

Balder and balder every haircut
Cutting a caper as lewd as he dare cut,
Quasiphilosophically Capricorn carouses
Ill at ease in such respectable houses,
The disinherited soul of an atrabilious
Semi self-deprecating paterfamilias.
With many eyeglitters at women's legs in stockings
with metaphysical justification as Dionysiac,
And ungenteel jokes undoubtedly due to his strabismus
Distorting even the quaint festivities of Christmas.
Remembering in the artificial afternoon
Old days when Pan his saxophonic tune
Under the ilex played, and how the figwood image
Nimbly swayed in the nights of lustful scrimmage,
And how in pleased surprise he uttered several Eurekas
At finding the gross fungus Ithyphallus Impudicus.
With him his father's hair his father's scalp reveals
Commensurate, with scratching too much during silent meals,
With virgin's blood the holly on the wall
Drips. As from Druid branches fail to fall
Light, intense pearl juices from alabaster fitting,
The proper tight-drawn hostess cuts unwitting
Symbols of fertility from Christmas cake. All jollity
Is fastened down. Only innocent frivolity
Saturnalia is allowed in houses of good quality.

Tiddledywog. Meh, meh. The door bursts open wide
The Sunday china stands up horrified.
Tiddledywog. Meh, meh. All he has ever remembered
Bulges out like a plaster panel badly distempered.
Tiddledywog. Meh, membrum caprinum erexit:
Culpabat, alia aliam, quia ipsa conspexit.
First he puts under the mat Persian cat and Pekinese dog.
Then the tables' and chairbacks' torselling
Smashes, and piles on potsherds of Worcester porcelain.
Dancing about he grips the frightened flapper's
Flaxen coils, throws to the ground and violates her.
Which done she becomes he: he hates her,
And turning on the boy, knocks his eyes out,
Strips him, and using sinewy tail as a knout
Flogs the boy till he eddies and faints. And the mother faints,
Whom Capricorn props up upon the chintz
And bathing her forehead with cold milk and tea
Reverses coldness that used to be.
But when she recovers, recovers himself and batters
The woman to death. This seems to mend matters.
Next pausing somewhat incommoded by his toils,
The carpets, cushions, colour schemes he soils.
Last in fierce memory of dislocate desire
The house itself he dislocates with fire.
Scatters the redhot imitation coals
Over this mortuary of human souls.
The imitation furniture goes up in smoke
And well fired china serves as admirable coke.
Like wood distilled that dribbles clammily
Oozes the ectoplasm of his burning family.
Various vermicular disseminations
Germinating from his character's past emanations,
Wriggle until he tramples them. This action
Causes him an electric satisfaction.
But as he leaves the drawing-room for the servants' hall
To seize the housemaid ere the whole place fall
He, bleating with dismay, or recognition rather,
Finds himself facing himself as his own father.
Incestuous terror tempts him to do patricide:
But this he cannot, lest it turn out suicide:
So forfeiting this chance of lovely pain,
Since man once killed can not have joy of killing self again,
And since the air is gradually overheating,
With slight discomfort in his merry bleating,
He leaves the house to meditate, quite decent, in the Park.

Attend the coda. Hardly out he passes
Ere the charred, smashed, cadaverous wilting masses,
Shape back to chintz and gilded wood and scones.
The ancient house of Capricorn & Sons
Stands unassailable in statu quo,
Unconscious of the wiles of wurrico.
Immaculate the virgin hopes her stare
Has an enlightened but offended air:
The boy unscarred eyes still the cakes and knees
Smiling as sticky as the things he sees:
The hostess volubly goes prattling on
Deadly and regular as Gatling gun:
With spurious teeth and with triangular feet
The friends tread on each other's corns and eat:
While Capricorn, morose from losing od,
Defends the Empire and the Will of God.

When you show yourself to the woman 

is not fear, itself. You have never been good,
but now you are so good,

who are you? Is it the liquidity of her skin
that bathes the world for you,

or her face, captured like a she-lion
in your own flesh?

This summerbed is soft with ring upon ring 
upon ring of wedding, the kind

with no contract,

the kind in which the gold is only (only!) light. 
Cloud covers and lifts, 

big fire laughs at a terrible burn, 

but only (only!) because pain absorbs excess 

We have the whole evening ahead of us,
We think, our eyesight starting to weaken,
We must have missed the houselights growing dim,
But how could that moment have escaped us when
The roots of the paper trees struck water
This nervous wood at the edge of a small,
Provincial town whose still lifes waken
And subject to the risk of animation?

The gradual reduction of Roman columns,
The disease of too many lakes and clouds.
Do cobblestones have a future? Is rain
Removable? Depressing mornings find
Characters in bed who have no reason
To get up, the light a yellowish half-light
Mirroring the mind, its sad affections.

At the lake, a flat of faultless summer
Is being taken down, the view abandoned;
The puzzled players change their places. Once
You might have found them walking in an orchard,
The blossoms opening their mouths to speak
And song occurring as if it were natural;
Now that trees uproot themselves and bankrupt
Agriculture wanes in its drying furrows,
Property and battlefields turn out to share

How simply the sun goes out like a match!
How deeply the wounds stay on the surface!
He said the best that can be said for property:
It lets an old man fall in love with landscape,
Lets so many trees have a chance to be noticed,
Allows the self-interested birds to preen,
Until the property is lost again.

To an upstart creditor who sells the trees
For lumber, then, to the sounds of saws,
Tramps through the hallway in his dirty boots
To explain, in tears, the dreary motivation:
With a boor . . . The Babel of trouble starts;
Among all the hells that go on talking,
Only one is real, though it is silent,
The land, to lose the very ground you stand on.

If the temporary brilliancies gather once more
In the middle distance, and the modal lark
Persuades the summer evening to reveal
One private little splendor not for sale,
Still, a gunshot, onstage or off,
Tells us what no one is prepared to know:
Love is a tourniquet tightening its bands
Around the slowly dying wrist of freedom,
A book of household accounts forever.

Bathed in the acid of truth, all things
Become possible: to be a cold snake
At an interview, to live on scraps of soap
To keep oneself warm, to resemble a cat
Constantly stalking the shadow of nothing,
Or the sound of a guitar from a neighboring room,
The doctor, with a smile, asks, What is man?
A hero about to be done-in for good?
A villain about to be rescued by pain?

The governess is wearing her old forage cap.
Astrov is talking about trees. We could be
Racing the wolves at thirty below
In a ravine whiplashed by snow, or slowly
Succumbing to boredom in a seaside town,
Waiting for a future that will never be,
The heat getting worse, far off the waves
Pounding faintly late in the moonlight,
At a low moment in our lives.

1.
 some things, I knew,
my children aborted, my poetry breathless forever.
2.
torn asunder permanently, drugged, numbed.
 some things I once believed in
choosing is a choice unavailable to me.

1
Who will honor the city without a name
If so many are dead and others pan gold
Or sell arms in faraway countries?

What shepherd's horn swathed in the bark of birch
Vagabonds, Pathfinders, brethren of a dissolved lodge?

This spring, in a desert, beyond a campsite flagpole,
I heard in a gray bush the buzzing of wild bees.

The current carried an echo and the timber of rafts.
A man in a visored cap and a woman in a kerchief
Pushed hard with their four hands at a heavy steering oar.

In the library, below a tower painted with the signs of the zodiac,
Kontrym would take a whiff from his snuffbox and smile
For despite Metternich all was not yet lost.

And on crooked lanes down the middle of a sandy highway
Jewish carts went their way while a black grouse hooted

2
In Death Valley I thought about styles of hairdo,
About a hand that shifted spotlights at the Student's Ball
In the city from which no voice could reach me.
Minerals did not sound the last trumpet.
There was only the rustle of a loosened grain of lava.

In Death Valley salt gleams from a dried-up lake bed.
Defend, defend yourself, says the tick-tock of the blood.
From the futility of solid rock, no wisdom.

In Death Valley no hawk or eagle against the sky.
The prediction of a Gypsy woman has come true.
In a lane under an arcade, then, I was reading a poem
Of someone who had lived next door, entitled "An Hour of Thought."

I looked long at the rearview mirror: there, the one man
Within three miles, an Indian, was walking a bicycle uphill.

3
With flutes, with torches
And a drum, boom, boom,
Look, the one who died in Istanbul, there, in the first row.
He walks arm in arm with his young lady,
And over them swallows fly.

They carry oars or staffs garlanded with leaves
And bunches of flowers from the shores of the Green Lakes,
As they came closer and closer, down Castle Street.
And then suddenly nothing, only a white puff of cloud
Over the Humanities Student Club,
Division of Creative Writing.

4
Books, we have written a whole library of them.
Lands, we have visited a great many of them.
Battles, we have lost a number of them.
Till we are no more, we and our Maryla.

5
Understanding and pity,
We value them highly.
What else?

Beauty and kisses,
Fame and its prizes,
Who cares?

Doctors and lawyers,
Well-turned-out majors,
Six feet of earth.

Rings, furs, and lashes,
Glances at Masses,
Rest in peace.

Sweet twin breasts, good night.
Sleep through to the light,
Without spiders.

6
The sun goes down above the Zealous Lithuanian Lodge
And kindles fire on landscapes "made from nature":
The valets had already brought in Theban candelabra
And pulled curtains, one after the other, slowly,
While, thinking I entered first, taking off my gloves,
I saw that all the eyes were fixed on me.

7
When I got rid of grieving
And the glory I was seeking,
Which I had no business doing,

I was carried by dragons
Over countries, bays, and mountains,
By fate, or by what happens.

Oh yes, I wanted to be me.
I toasted mirrors weepily
And learned my own stupidity.

From nails, mucous membrane,
Lungs, liver, bowels, and spleen
Whose house is made? Mine.

So what else is new?
I am not my own friend.
Time cuts me in two.

Monuments covered with snow,
Accept my gift. I wandered;
And where, I don't know.

8
Absent, burning, acrid, salty, sharp.
Thus the feast of Insubstantiality.
Under a gathering of clouds anywhere.
In a bay, on a plateau, in a dry arroyo.
No density. No harness of stone.
Even the Summa thins into straw and smoke.
And the angelic choirs fly over in a pomegranate seed
Sounding every few instants, not for us, their trumpets.

9
Light, universal, and yet it keeps changing.
For I love the light too, perhaps the light only.
Yet what is too dazzling and too high is not for me.
So when the clouds turn rosy, I think of light that is level
In the lands of birch and pine coated with crispy lichen,
Late in autumn, under the hoarfrost when the last milk caps
Rot under the firs and the hounds' barking echoes,
And jackdaws wheel over the tower of a Basilian church.

10
Unexpressed, untold.
But how?
The shortness of life,
the years quicker and quicker,
not remembering whether it happened in this or that autumn.
Retinues of homespun velveteen skirts,
giggles above a railing, pigtails askew,
sittings on chamberpots upstairs
when the sledge jingles under the columns of the porch
just before the moustachioed ones in wolf fur enter.
Female humanity,
children's snots, legs spread apart,
snarled hair, the milk boiling over,
And those centuries,
conceiving in the herring smell of the middle of the night
instead of playing something like a game of chess
or dancing an intellectual ballet.
And palisades,
and pregnant sheep,
and cows cured by incantations.

11
Not the Last Judgment, just a kermess by a river.
Small whistles, clay chickens, candied hearts.
So we trudged through the slush of melting snow
To buy bagels from the district of Smorgonie.

A fortune-teller hawking: "Your destiny, your planets."
And a toy devil bobbing in a tube of crimson brine.
Another, a rubber one, expired in the air squeaking,
By the stand where you bought stories of King Otto and Melusine.

12
Why should that city, defenseless and pure as the wedding necklace of
a forgotten tribe, keep offering itself to me?
Like blue and red-brown seeds beaded in Tuzigoot in the copper desert
seven centuries ago.

Where ocher rubbed into stone still waits for the brow and cheekbone
it would adorn, though for all that time there has been no one.

What evil in me, what pity has made me deserve this offering?

It stands before me, ready, not even the smoke from one chimney is
lacking, not one echo, when I step across the rivers that separate us.

inside Arizona, because except fo me no one else knows that they ever
lived.

They trot before me on Embankment Street, two hently born parakeets
from Samogitia, and at night they unravel their spinster tresses of gray
hair.

Here there is no earlier and no later; the seasons of the year and of the
day are simultaneous.

at the gate collect the turnpike toll in leather bags.

Rattling their wheels, "Courier" and "Speedy" move against the current
to Werki, and an oarsman shot down over England skiffs past, spread-
eagled by his oars.

At St. Peter and Paul's the angels lower their thick eyelids in a smile
over a nun who has indecent thoughts.

Bearded, in a wig, Mrs. Sora Klok sits at the counter, instructing her
twelve shopgirls.

And all of German Street tosses into the air unfurled bolts of fabric,
preparing itself for death and the conquest of Jerusalem.

Black and princely, an underground river knocks at cellars of the
cathedral under the tomb of St. Casimir the Young and under the
half-charred oak logs in the hearth.

Carrying her servant's-basket on her shoulder, Barbara, dressed in
mourning, returns from the Lithuanian Mass at St. Nicholas to the
Romers' house in Bakszta Street.

How it glitters! the snow on Three Crosses Hill and Bekiesz Hill, not
to be melted by the breath of these brief lives.

And what do I know now, when I turn into Arsenal Street and open
my eyes once more on a useless end of the world?

I was running, as the silks rustled, through room after room without
stopping, for I believed in the existence of a last door.

But the shape of lips and an apple and a flower pinned to a dress were
all that one was permitted to know and take away.

The Earth, neither compassionate nor evil, neither beautiful nor atro-
cious, persisted, innocent, open to pain and desire.

And the gift was useless, if, later on, in the flarings of distant nights,
there was not less bitterness but more.

If I cannot so exhaust my life and their life that the bygone crying is
transformed, at last, into harmony.

have had to do it. We were used to this

Mist clogs the sunshine. 
Smoky dwarf houses 
Hem me round everywhere; 
A vague dejection 
Weighs down my soul. 

Yet, while I languish, 
Everywhere countless 
Prospects unroll themselves, 
And countless beings 
Pass countless moods. 

Far hence, in Asia, 
On the smooth convent-roofs, 
On the gilt terraces, 
Of holy Lassa, 
Bright shines the sun. 

Grey time-worn marbles 
Hold the pure Muses; 
In their cool gallery, 
By yellow Tiber, 
They still look fair. 

Strange unloved uproar 
Shrills round their portal; 
Yet not on Helicon 
Kept they more cloudless 
Their noble calm. 

Through sun-proof alleys 
In a lone, sand-hemm'd 
City of Africa, 
A blind, led beggar, 
Age-bow'd, asks alms. 

No bolder robber 
Erst abode ambush'd 
Deep in the sandy waste; 
No clearer eyesight 
Spied prey afar. 

Saharan sand-winds 
Sear'd his keen eyeballs; 
Spent is the spoil he won. 
For him the present 
Holds only pain. 

Two young, fair lovers, 
Where the warm June-wind, 
Fresh from the summer fields 
Plays fondly round them, 
Stand, tranced in joy. 

With sweet, join'd voices, 
And with eyes brimming: 
"Ah," they cry, "Destiny, 
Prolong the present! 
Time, stand still here!" 

The prompt stern Goddess 
Shakes her head, frowning; 
Time gives his hour-glass 
Its due reversal; 
Their hour is gone. 

With weak indulgence 
Did the just Goddess 
Lengthen their happiness, 
She lengthen'd also 
Distress elsewhere. 

The hour, whose happy 
Unalloy'd moments 
I would eternalise, 
Ten thousand mourners 
Well pleased see end. 

The bleak, stern hour, 
Whose severe moments 
I would annihilate, 
Is pass'd by others 
In warmth, light, joy. 

Time, so complain'd of, 
Who to no one man 
Shows partiality, 
Brings round to all men 
Some undimm'd hours. 

I cannot change, as others do,
      Though you unjustly scorn;
    Since that poor swain, that sighs for you
      For you alone was born.
    No, Phyllis, no, your heart to move
    And to revenge my slighted love,
Will still love on, will still love on, and die.

      And you to mind shall call
    The sighs that now unpitied rise;
      The tears that vainly fall:
    That welcome hour that ends this smart,
      Will then begin your pain;
    For such a faithful, tender heart
Can never break, can never break in vain.

But how choose the appropriate sticking point to start at?

Delights often wreathed with necessary pain, like the stout unforgiving thorns

The oldest sister, her two hands on the table,
about to push herself up, stares with grim
determination at the affronting dishes,
waiting, it seems, until the middle sister
finishes her story, so she can clear them away.
Her gaze so tense with purpose she can almost
see germs spawning in the mess of white fish
flaking from the spines, the smear of egg yolk
and the torn rolls disfiguring the china;
as if the meal, the moment it is over,
the meal she made a point of telling them
she shopped for, got up early to prepare,
were now inedible, because uneaten.

Or that the cigarette between her fingers

Her death is just three months away.

the brother and middle sister would be home,
with sunlight only just now catching on
a corner of the window shut behind them,
shut against the smog, the steady traffic
and the panicked blare and drawn-out whining fade
still cool enough, right now, to keep the body
in the wavering frail zone of what it needs
to be forgotten, so they can sit like this
on the wrecked meal, the brother and sister talking:

Listen, she would be saying, listen, Charlie,
her elbows on the table, both hands open,
What can you do? What are ya gonna do?
sudden illness (And he was my age, just
how sick she got, she always had her hair done),
his back pain, her arthritis, or the daughter
after his joke about the nurse, and hers
about the bedpan, Listen, they each say,
Listen, what are ya gonna do?

until he told her that he had a problem,
that was his first mistake, then he goes
so of course what happens is she wakes up
and finds him weeping at the kitchen table,
you know, nuts, nuts, so naturally she leaves him,

but surely coming for them (the way the sun
burns brick by brick all morning toward the window

her shoulders in a way they recognize
as hers, the way their mother did; as if
all trouble were, for now, no heavier
than the familiar voice repeating, Listen,
what happens what was only meant to happen,
coherent with fate, fated as family.

After the funeral three months from now,
tell them they had no business moving away
to Florida, and Irene sick as she was.
And selfish. She was selfish, that one. After
all those years of living with that bum,
her husband, may his cheap soul rest in peace,
And anyway, what could be done for her?
for her to sit all day, and smoke, and not care
ashes were falling on the couch, the carpet;
and now they will hear the old unfairnesses,
old feuds and resentments come to her voice
like consolation, like a mother helping
all that smoke, and running in with nothing
but the dishtowel to beat down the flames,
and Irene, just Irene, just sitting there,
since she was there, she was always there,
her big sister, to clean up the mess?

Only three months, and yet it could be years,
or decades, for the sun has only just now
caught in the window, and its bright plaque warms
the air so gradually that none of them
distracted by a faint sheen prickling the skin,
will break the story, look up toward the window
and, startled by the full glare, check the time.
Right now, though, the future is a luxury
of instances in which the cigarette,
raised halfway to the lips, will go on rising.
Nothing bad, right now, can happen here
except as news, bad news the brother and sister
mull and rehearse, puzzle and fret until
it seems the very telling of it is
what keeps them safe. And safe, too, the oldest sister,
dreaming of all the perishables sealed,
uncontaminated airlessness,
dreaming of how the soapsuds curdle and slide
over the dishes in a soothing fury,
not minding that it scalds her hands to hold
each plate and cup and bowl under the hot,
hard jet of water, if it gets them clean.

No surprise. Bills to pay, pain to obliterate,

for more time before facing facts,
or a reason less beholden to One-day-at-a-time

A plastic tarp in a monsoon may be
her future. A plush ride home to havoc.
A vision that delivers her from want,
deserving or not.

The day the war against Iraq begins
With their outstretched arms and ruffled cups
Blowing in the wind of Jesus Green

Edging the lush grassy moving river
Along with the swans and ducks
Under a soft March Cambridge sky
Embellishing the earth like a hand

Where people in light clothes come out
To play, to frisk and run about
With their lovers, friends, animals, and children

As down every stony back road of history
The daffodils do look as if they dance

And make some of us in the park want to dance
And breathe deeply and I know that
Being able to eat and incorporate beauty like this
I am privileged and by that token can

The cruel wars are good the stupidity is good,
The primates hiding in their caves are very good,
They do their best, which explains poetry.

What explains poetry is that life is hard
But better than the alternatives,
The no and the nothing. Look at this light
And color, a splash of brilliant yellow

Punctuating an emerald text, white swans
And mottled brown ducks floating quietly along
Whole and alive, like an untorn language
That lacks nothing, that excludes

It is our business to defend it
Even the day our masters start a war?
To defend the day we see the daffodils?

The blood I staunch, and wound I seal. 
Only for him no cure is found, 

After the cocoon I was in a human body

where I felt wings behind me, trying

to tilt me back. They succeeded in doing so
after a day of exertion. I called that time,

overwhelmed with the ghosts of my wings, sleep.

I took pleasure in climbing trees. I snuck food
into all my pains. My mouth produced language

which I attempted to spin over myself
and rip through happier and healthier.

What made me such a failure?

a grown creature telling ghost stories,

staring at pictures, paralyzed for hours.

an undertow sucking me back into myself.

like a boy who takes a razor from a high cabinet
puffs out his cheeks and strips them bloody.

in the marketplace
near your father's church
witness to this love
in this calm fallow
of these minds,
there is no substitute for pain:
genitals gone or going,
seed burned out,
you tuck the roots in the earth,
turn back, and move
by river through the swamps,
singing: a love supreme, a love supreme;
what does it all mean?
Loss, so great each black
woman expects your failure
in mute change, the seed gone.
your song now crystal and
the blues. You pick up the horn
with some will and blow
into the freezing night:

Dawn comes and you cook
up the thick sin 'tween
impotence and death, fuel
the tenor sax cannibal
heart, genitals, and sweat

Why you so black?
cause I am
why you so funky?
cause I am
why you so black?
cause I am
why you so sweet?
cause I am
why you so black?
cause I am
a love supreme, a love supreme:

So sick
you couldn't play Naima,
so flat we ached
for song you'd concealed
with your own blood,
your diseased liver gave
out its purity,
the inflated heart
pumps out, the tenor kiss,
tenor love:

rind. Love held tight in a sonnet.

A sobering thought, the idea of you stretched there,
bittern, under a dark sky, your exposed bones
yellow too in a ditch among cold stones,
ice glittering everywhere on bog and river,
the whole unfortunate country frozen over
a thought more wrenching than the fall of Troy
of delight from a pale patch of watery sunlight
out on the mud there as you took your first
drink of the day and now, destroyed by thirst,
you lie in brambles while the rats rotate.
now, had I known it, we might both be drinking
and singing too; for ours is the same story.
and lie shivering like you under whin-bushes;
but I mourn only the bittern, withdrawn and solitary,
who used to carouse alone among the rushes
and sleep rough in the star-glimmering bog-drain.
It used to be, with characters like us,
but now they have a cure for these psychoses
as indeed they do for most social diseases
and, rich at last, we can forget our pain.
so now, relieved of dangerous stimuli,
as peace with my plastic bottle of H2O
and the slack strings of insouciance, I sit
but the fast bright zing of a winter afternoon
dizzy with head-set, flash-bulb and digifone,
to learn the tao he once claimed as his own
and share with him the moor-hen and the swan,
the thoughtless lyric of a cloud in the sky
and the play of light and shadow on the slow
commemorative waters; relax, go with the flow.

Last night I heard your voice, mother,
    The words you sang to me
When I, a little barefoot boy,
    Knelt down against your knee.

And tears gushed from my heart, mother,
    And passed beyond its wall,
But though the fountain reached my throat
    The drops refused to fall.

'Tis ten years since you died, mother,
    Just ten dark years of pain,
And oh, I only wish that I
    Could weep just once again.

The sun is warm, the sky is clear,

From the far star points of his pinned extremities,

Greed got in the way. We built a fake estate.
Levinas said to see ourselves we need each other yet

doorbells, rows of them, glow in the night village
a string of lit invitations no elbow has leaned into

the doors are rotting from the bottom up.

Hard core from the quarry might make it level,

hard core and cunning speculation into matters
concerning love and doubt, concerning want and plenty.

O the places where pavement runs out and ragwort

tumbleweeds, bin bags, rebar, roof slates, offcuts,

guttering, drain grilles, doodads, infill, gravel!
A not-as-yet nice establishment, possessing potential

where we have no authorized voice but are oddly fitted
out for the pain it takes to build bit by bit.

When the last contractions brought us to the brink
of our new predicament, we became developers.

You love your friend, so you fly across the country to see her.

You try across with your friend. You try around.

When we stop where you lived, the house
 has thickened, the entry
 level to the wall with bricks, as though
 it could keep you out.
 Again the dream has fooled you into waking
 and we have walked out
 past ourselves, through the windows
 to be remembered in the light
 of closed rooms
 as a series of impositions
 startled out of us so it lingers
 along a brick front.
 You are leading me back to the burned arcade
 where you said I stood with you
 in your childhood last night, your childhood
 which includes me now
 as surely as the look of that missing face
 between the rows of houses.
 We have gone so far into your past
 that nothing reflects us.
 No sun gleams from the glassless frame
 where a room burned,
 though the house stayed whole. There 
 is your school, your church, 
 the place you drank cider at lunch time.
 New rows of houses are going up.
 Children play quietly in a stairwell.
 Walking back, you tell the story
 making two clean holes in the taxi, how
 the driver ducked and drove on
 like nothing happened. No pain
 passed through you; it
 did not even stop the car
 or make you live more
 carefully. Near the check point we 
 stop talking, you let the hands
 rub your clothes
 against your body. You seem to be 
 there, all there.
 Watching, I am more apart
 for the sign of dismissal they will give me,
 thinking a woman would not conceal
 as I have, the perfect map
 of this return where I have met 
 and lost you willingly
 in a dead and living place.
 Now when you find me next in the dream,
 this boundary will move with us.
 We will both come back.

Now he jams himself at pace between a giant planter
and cross-braced

at Finnegans.
And wham. The guy is smack on his ass, un-staring up
to heaven,
stunned.

The worst for him was his friend turned wolf,
and the blood that splattered as he ran. The worst
for us: the hospital, his upper lip tugged back
that rubs pain out. He submits
to the quick stitch, the thread black
against pink skin, calm now he sees
the doctor can be trusted, his voice
soothing, his face clean shaven,
the clues that signal kindness to a child.
were over when it leapt for his throat
and caught his mouth. The scars, at least,
no beast will tear into his dreams. And we
will want him there, our bodies makeshift walls.
We who led the stranger to our home,
fixed him a bowl, taught him to sleep
under our blankets, we who taught our son
to rub the muzzle that sheathes the teeth.

When I dare at last to imagine hunger,
see farmer wandering his parched fields
knowing nothing to do, finally, but sleep
the day out in the barn's long shadow,
dreaming of the family dog he drove
deep into a neighboring county
and abandoned by the side of the road.
timid and gimp, a halo of gnats
festering between its swollen testicles
into some pines, tethers it with a tentstake
and a chain as the late summer light
spirals and drapes over the branches,
a mirage the dog slavers and snaps at.
Consider the boy's amusement
as he imagines the animal jerking the light
down and the ruckus of bells that clang
and catapult from the treetop belfries,
and circus peanuts, coins and fluttering dollar bills.
The real possibilities are beyond him.
The dog as a parable of pain or loss.
Hunger as some small iridescent thing at work
inside the animal, hovering around its heart
the way a lone dragonfly skirts the dry pond crater,
from dust, dust unbuckled from air.
By now, the dog's given up, and the boy
watches its tongue loll in the pine needles,
the heave and fall of its stomach, its eyes
following birdflight in and out of the shade.
Restless for something he cannot name,
he imagines the music he might make
if he thumped the dog's belly like a drum.
Imagines its eyes are the color of iron.
Imagines the unimaginable and does it,
the tire tool and the belly unwilling instruments,
and the dog's caterwaul is not like music
at all and when night comes the cricketsong
dulcifies nothing, the dog's body
is just a body, is not paltry, is not glorified.
What hunger is this that haunts the boy,
that haunts the man sleeping in the shade?
Watch as the dragonfly dips into his open mouth
and keeps going, a blur between bone and sinew,
a wet thread collapsing soft caverns of flesh,
gone to where his body is a field
honed by sleeves of sunlight,
to where the boy ceases to be and the man wakes.
He knows what flits through him now
keeps the time with its thrumming,
carrying him away from himself
in the heat, a winnowing sliver of light.

1. Animals

Cows we bought in Salzburg form a tiny herd.
Or seven universal poses are assumed by cats.

Misery, hypocrisy, greed: A dying
Uniforms and frock coats exhibit these traits.
Of their creation with a poetry at once too vague

And too precise to do anything with but
By accident, completely comprehending
About them; but they never speak. They never even move

A sort of ghostly wolf, a lizard, an ape
At nothing, manage to see everything invisible

To ours, even with all the time in the world
Of this in the only way we really can:
In which it is to be left hanging; or a stiff scream,

Folded like a sheet of paper over all
Going to have. That vanished before our eyes
Our words, poor animals whose home is in another world.

Tiny outbursts of sunlight play
Strewn on the surface of the bay.
Up the coast the water backs up
According to photographs, it is less
Reflecting it, allowing beaten silver sheets
Ends abruptly in the forest on the shore.

Which heaven has finally made clear.

Green lichen fastened to a blue rock
Everything that sustains it: the dead leaves
When autumn drops its tear upon them, turn.

Mine and it was like dying: alone,
Huddled under the cold blue dome of the stars,
I kept trying to look at myself. It was like looking into the sun and I went blind.

O, to break open that inert light
Like a stone and let the vision slowly sink down
I was getting so tired of that excuse: refusing love
Acts and words of love; until a soft monstrosity of song
Has come and only starlight trickles through the dome;

And yet I only wanted to be happy.
I wanted rest and innocence; a place
Where I could hide each secret fear by blessing it,
I tried to crawl inside the heavy, slaughtered hands of love
Like a stab of paradise: explode: and then at last
Exhausted, heal into pain. And that was happiness:
A dream whose ending never ends, a vein

Of blood, a hollow entity
Consumed by consummation, bleeding so.
In the sky our eyes ascend to as they sweep
Lullabies and children wake up glistening with screams
They left asleep; and the dead are dead. The wounded worship death
And live a little while in love; and then are gone.
Until we know, until we come to recognize as ours,
Those other lives that live within us as our own.
We had been married for six or seven years 
when my wife, standing in the kitchen one afternoon, told me

that, in fact, she has been screaming for years
into the blue chlorinated water of the community pool

Buttering her toast, not as if she had been 
concealing anything, 
not as if I should consider myself

personally the cause of her screaming,
right that minute on the kitchen table,

and I could see her turn her square face up 
to take a gulp of oxygen,

then down again into the cold wet mask of the unconscious.
For all I know, maybe everyone is screaming 
as they go through life, silently,

politely keeping the big secret 
that it is not all fun
to be ripped by the crooked beak

of something called psychology,
to be dipped down 
again and again into time;

that the truest, most intimate 
pleasure you can sometimes find
is the wet kiss 

of your own pain.
There goes Kath, at one pm, to swim her twenty-two laps
back and forth in the community pool; 

Twenty-two laps like twenty-two pages, 
that will never be read by anyone.

The sea is calm tonight. 
The tide is full, the moon lies fair 
Upon the straits; on the French coast the light 
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand, 
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. 
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! 
Only, from the long line of spray 
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land, 
Listen! you hear the grating roar 
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling, 
At their return, up the high strand, 
Begin, and cease, and then again begin, 
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring 
The eternal note of sadness in. 

Sophocles long ago 
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow 
Of human misery; we 
Find also in the sound a thought, 
Hearing it by this distant northern sea. 

The Sea of Faith 
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled. 
But now I only hear 
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar, 
Retreating, to the breath 
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear 
And naked shingles of the world. 

Ah, love, let us be true 
To one another! for the world, which seems 
To lie before us like a land of dreams, 
So various, so beautiful, so new, 
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, 
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; 
And we are here as on a darkling plain 
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, 
Where ignorant armies clash by night.

People traveled from miles away to see
the jeweled armor of their scales, the beadlike

set of their eyes in
rubbery socket rings, the glimmering
swish of fin and tail

so real it seemed that you could almost dip
a net deep into
the paper and pull up the arching wet

weight of a golden carp,
a shiny trout, or the dark muscular
heft of a bass with

its mouth stretched into the surprised, wiry
sock. I captured my models from the sea,

lake, and goldfish pond
in the back garden, so careful not to
let their mouths be torn

by the hook, their scales chipped, or the silky
tissue of their tails
ripped by a clumsy hand. I kept them in

large glass bowls, fed them
mosquito wings or dry silkworm pupas
offered from chopsticks,

and when I was finished making sketches,
I quickly took them
back and set them free again. Every

night I dream I swim

pulled to the surface by the deceptive
creamy luster of
the moon or the sizzle of firefly lights

across the water.
And every night I am tempted once
again by the smell

of the baited hook, by my predictable
hunger for earthly
things, and each time I am surprised again

by the stinging hook
in my lip that pulls me mercilessly
into the bright air,

setting my gills on fire, the sharp, silver
pain of the knife that
slits me open so easily from tail

to throat to reveal
the scarlet elastic of my raw gills,
the translucent film

of my air sac, the milky rise of my
stomach, and the gray
marbled coil of my intestines. I rise

late each day, and work
in brighter light. When I die, I will
have my paintings brought

down to the lake and slipped into the water.
First the edges of
ink will blur, and then there will be a great

flurry as the fins,
tails, and bodies begin blossoming in-
to life again, each

fish detaching from its canvas of silk
swirl of color, motion, swimming away.

Where sunless rivers weep
Their waves into the deep,
She sleeps a charmed sleep:
      Awake her not.
Led by a single star,
She came from very far
To seek where shadows are
      Her pleasant lot.

She left the rosy morn,
She left the fields of corn,
For twilight cold and lorn
      And water springs.
Through sleep, as through a veil,
She sees the sky look pale,
And hears the nightingale
      That sadly sings.

Rest, rest, a perfect rest
Shed over brow and breast;
Her face is toward the west,
      The purple land.
She cannot see the grain
Ripening on hill and plain;
She cannot feel the rain
      Upon her hand.

Rest, rest, for evermore
Upon a mossy shore;
Rest, rest at the heart's core
      Till time shall cease:
Sleep that no pain shall wake;
Night that no morn shall break
Till joy shall overtake
      Her perfect peace.

Myself I'm like a dress my mother made
me, a fabric self split open with a sigh
material than we'd had before. I got
the sense it was all wasted on me.
But a needle's sharp to pierce, is itself
Like I learned: no dress could ever be
beautiful or best if it had me in it.
I was the stain in a place we couldn't fix.
Having fallen on a slicer of some kind.
Double-seamed, scabbed over, a new body
pocket in the pattern. How to stitch up
that wound right into the clean vertical rip
in some on-sale flannelette?
I'd never again be cold. Skin's holey not holy.
In mad winter alone with drink, I think:
tattoo needles don't use thread but ink
to mark a place in this ever-moving skin
and that wound is ornament. But who
needs a mark to know what's marked?
I would pray to the dark in the dark.
But what did I ask for, what did I know
to ask for? Nonfatal wounds: they're there
when we die, deliquescent, vibrating like a drum
skin just after each beat moves off.
A part of music. A way a body keeps time,
is time's keeper, vigilant till time up and goes
to find another body. Another's warmth
and shelter. Or related injuries. Anyone
who hurts another was hurt that same way,
so how far back behind our backs do we go
to finally find the first hurt; whose finger
points to say, "You! You're the one who god
knows why started a cycle of unending pain,"
to someone's child in short pants?
A baby just torn a hole in her amnion swirl?
And what of me? I can't tell where my flesh
meets the rest of me, ragbag full of rags,
shot full of holes but that's just the way cotton
and silk and everything I said up till now looks
when it hits the air and is cried on. I'm so inside
out I evaporated entirely already as August does,
unsalvageable. Who would ever love me like this?
And just like that, I stopped thinking about it.
I agree to meet you at the ferry heading to a place
neither of us wants to go but both just said
sure, I'll go... if you want! We should turn back,
nobody said. Oh we should before it's too late,
nobody said again, insistent this time.

1.
 The earth is dry and they live wanting.
 Each with a small reservoir
 Of furious music heavy in the throat.
 They drag it out and with nails in their feet
 Coax the night into being. Brief believing.
 A skirt shimmering with sequins and lies.
 And in this night that is not night,
 Each word is a wish, each phrase
 They defy gravity to feel tugged back.
 The clatter, the mad slap of landing.
 And not just them. Not just
Primitos, not just the bailaor
 Whose heels have notched 
 And hammered time
 So the hours flow in place
 Like a tin river, marking
 Only what once was.
Not just the voices of scraping
 Against the river, nor the hands 
 Nudging them farther, fingers
 Like blind birds, palms empty, 
 Echoing. Not just the women
 With sober faces and flowers
 In their hair, the ones who dance
 Beneath them.
 To set myself heavily beside them.
 The body a myth, a parable
 For what not even language
 Moves quickly enough to name.
 If I call it pain, and try to touch it
 With my hands, my own life,
 It lies still and the music thins,
 A pulse felt for through garments. 
 If I lean unbuttoned into the blow
 Of loss after loss, love tossed
 It carries me with it farther,
 To chords that stretch and bend
 Like light through colored glass.
 But it races on, toward shadows
 Where the world I know
 And the world I fear
 Threaten to meet.
 There is always a road,
 The sea, dark hair, dolor.
 Always a question

When my brother came home from war 
he carried his left arm in a black sling 
but assured us most of it was still there. 
Spring was late, the trees forgot to leaf out. 

I stood in a long line waiting for bread. 
The woman behind me said it was shameless, 
someone as strong as I still home, still intact 
while her Michael was burning to death. 

Yes, she could feel the fire, could smell 
younger than I, who was only fourteen, 

taller, more handsome in his white uniform 
turning slowly gray the way unprimed wood 
grays slowly in the grate when the flames 

she said when I turned to face her. She placed 
both hands on my shoulders, kissed each eyelid, 
hugged me to her breasts and whispered wetly 

When I got home my brother ate the bread 
carefully one slice at a time until 

That afternoon I walked the crowded streets 
something familiar, a face or a voice or less, 
but not these shards of ash that fell from heaven.

of eagles over the block, right over our house,
not more than twenty feet above the roof,
so massive their wings pull at the corrugated
tin sheeting even with gentlest tilt, counteracts
bitterness against all the damage I see and hear
around me on an exclusively crisp blue morning,
when clarity is pain and even one small missing
wattle tree, entirely vanquished since I was last here 
a region is not a pinpoint and a different compass
works in my head, having magnetics for all
directions and all pointing to one spot 
I know and observe as closely as possible; 
and even one small vanished or vanquished
wattle tree is agony close to death for me,
where I find it hard to breathe to feed myself
to get past the loss; but the pair of eagles
still appearing and keeping their sharp
and scrupulous eyes honed, overrides
this ordeal, though I wish their victims
life too and their damage is traumatic
or nonsense as I can make in such blue light.

The driver  Hassan with his camels past.
One cruse of water on his back he bore,
And his light scrip contained a scanty store:
A fan of painted feathers in his hand,
To guard his shaded face from scorching sand.
The sultry sun had gained the middle sky,
And not a tree, and not an herb was nigh.
The beasts, with pain, their dusty way pursue,
Shrill roared the winds, and dreary was the view!
Thrice sighted, thrice struck his breast, and thus began:
Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,

for the chance at the chair
while the eagle claws holes
a fisted comb through stubborn
faced boys asking Eddie
to cut in parts and arrows
wanting to have their names read
stopping their games of ivory

A learned and a happy ignorance 
From all the sloth, care, pain, and sorrow that advance 
Of men. No error, no distraction I 
Saw soil the earth, or overcloud the sky. 

The world; nor did I dream of such a thing 
They all were brisk and living wights to me, 
Yea, pure and full of immortality. 

My ears and heart did fill and freely move. 
The Universe was then a world of treasure, 
To me an universal world of pleasure. 

Shops, markets, taverns, coaches, were unshown; 

As yet lay under ground; my blessed fate 
And innocent delights which he did see 
In his original simplicity. 

Was my protection when I first was born. 
Which God first made. The first effects of love 
My first enjoyments upon earth did prove; 

Them here at first, they did my soul allure, 
Quite from the works of men; that I might see 
The glorious wonders of the Deity.

Supper comes at five o'clock,
    At six, the evening star,
    But eight o'clock is far.

How could I bear my pain all day
    Unless I watched to see
The clock-hands laboring to bring
    Eight o'clock to me.

Those twenty-six letters filling the blackboard
Compose the dark, compose
The illiterate summer sky & its stars as they appear

One by one, above the schoolyard.

If the soul had a written history, nothing would have happened:
A bird would still be riding the back of a horse,

And the horse would go on grazing in a field, & the gleaners,

At one with the land, the wind, the sun examining
Their faces, would go on working,

Each moment forgotten in the swipe of a scythe.

But the walls of the labyrinth have already acquired
Their rose tint from the blood of slaves
Crushed into the stone used to build them, & the windows

Of stained glass are held in place by the shriek

And sighing body of a falling chimneysweep through
The baked & blackened air. This ash was once a village,

That snowflake, time itself.

But until the day it is permitted to curl up in a doorway,
And try to sleep, the snow falling just beyond it,

The soul rests its head in its hands & stares out
From its desk at the trash-littered schoolyard,

It stays where it was left.
When the window fills with pain, the soul bears witness,

Having no need to, having no home.
In this way, & in no other

Was the soul gradually replaced by the tens of thousands

All of which proclaimed, or else lamented, its absence.

Until, in the drone of auditoriums & lecture halls, it became
No more than the scraping of a branch
Against the side of a house, no more than the wincing

Of a patient on a couch, or the pinched, nasal tenor

While this sound of scratching, this tapping all night,
Enlarging the quiet instead of making a music within it,

Is just a way of joining one thing to another,

Coming home with the last load I ride standing
on the wagon tongue, behind the tractor
in hot exhaust, lank with sweat,

my arms strung
awkwardly along the hayrack, cruciform.

this afternoon, Marshall and I.
And of course I think of another who hung
like this on another cross. My hands are torn

by baling twine, not nails, and my side is pierced
by my ulcer, not a lance. The acid in my throat
is only hayseed. Yet exhaustion and the way

my body hangs from twisted shoulders, suspended
on two points of pain in the rising
monoxide, recall that greater suffering.

Well, I change grip and the image
brought on the grass tremendously, a monster crop,

but wet, always wet. Haying was long delayed.
Now is our last chance to bring in

We mow, rake, bale, and draw the bales
to the barn, these late, half-green,
improperly cured bales; some weigh 150 pounds

or more, yet must be lugged by the twine
across the field, tossed on the load, and then
at the barn unloaded on the conveyor

and hold up my end pretty well too; but God,

the close of day, how I fall down then. My hands
are sore, they flinch when I light my pipe.
I think of those who have done slave labor,

less able and less well prepared than I.
Rose Marie in the rye fields of Saxony,
her father in the camps of Moldavia

and the Crimea, all clerks and housekeepers
herded to the gaunt fields of torture. Hands
too bloodied cannot bear

even the touch of air, even
the touch of love. I have a friend
whose grandmother cut cane with a machete

and cut and cut, until one day
she snicked her hand off and took it
and threw it grandly at the sky. Now

in September our New England mountains
begin to glow, maples, beeches, birches

in their first color. I look
beyond our famous hayfields to our famous hills,
to the notch where the sunset is beginning,

then in the other direction, eastward,
where a full new-risen moon like a pale
medallion hangs in a lavender cloud

beyond the barn. My eyes
sting with sweat and loveliness. And who
is the Christ now, who

if not I? It must be so. My strength
is legion. And I stand up high
on the wagon tongue in my whole bones to say

woe to you, watch out
you sons of bitches who would drive men and women
to the fields where they can only die.

there was hunger prefossil, 

there was pain before a nervous system  
to convey it to the brain, there existed 

poverty before intelligence, or accountants,  
before narration; there was bankruptcy aswirl 

in nowhere, it was palpable 
where nothing was palpable, there was repossession 

in the gasses forming so many billion ... ; 

ash, in marl, and coming loam, 
thirst in the few strands of hay slipping 

in the reptile and the first birds, 

poverty aloof and no mystery like God  
its maker; there was surely want 

in one steamed and sagging onion,  
there was poverty in the shard of bread 

sopped in the final drop of gravy 

First the bad boots
give up their strength, then the toes lift
their anchors. The ankle
bones are broken, 
and so on, until the bladder lets go, without 
shame, and the genital 
organ washes away, the ovum 
and her fertile signals. A proxy pain 
stands in for the larger
intangible.

Has nothing to do
with tufts of snow blown upon
the unforgiving surface,
but how I mistook the beauty of those particle
deaths, their of-the-world
stardom, as a kind of metaphysical river,
that if I looked long enough,
with enough reverence...

Let my waist, bled numb, stand in
for that miscalculation. And the severed 
blown off the stricken
self. I saw formal water,
knowing my body wanted to go there.
My only child. How

If we could get the hang of it entirely

If we could find our happiness entirely
But, as it is, the spears each year go through

And if the world were black or white entirely
Instead of a mad weir of tigerish waters,
Bored but in brute reality there is no

On a Panel in the Hall of the Institute of Journalists

We have served our day.
I

Rose of fate, you looked for ways to wound us
yet you bent like the secret about to be released
and the command you chose to give us was beautiful
and your smile was like a ready sword.

The ascent of your cycle livened creation
our impulse dawned naked to possess you
the world was easy: a simple pulsation.

The secrets of the sea are forgotten on the shores
the darkness of the depths is forgotten in the surf;
the corals of memory suddenly shine purple. . .
O do not stir. . . listen to hear its light

motion. . . you touched the tree with the apples
the hand reached out, the thread points the way and guides you. . .
O dark shivering in the roots and the leaves
if it were but you who would bring the forgotten dawn!

May lilies blossom again on the meadow of separation
may days open mature, the embrace of the heavens,
may those eyes alone shine in the glare
the pure soul be outlined like the song of a flute.

Was it night that shut its eyes? Ashes remain,
as from the string of a bow a choked hum remains,
ash and dizziness on the black shore
and dense fluttering imprisoned in surmise.

Rose of the wind, you knew but took us unknowing
at a time when thought was building bridges
so that fingers would knit and two fates pass by
and spill into the low and rested light.

O dark shivering in the roots and the leaves!
Come forth sleepless form in the gathering silence
raise your head from your cupped hands
so that your will be done and you tell me again

the words that touched and merged with the blood like an embrace;
and let your desire, deep like the shade of a walnut tree, bend
and flood us with your lavish hair
from the down of the kiss to the leaves of the heart.

You lowered your eyes and you had the smile
that masters of another time humbly painted.
Forgotten reading from an ancient gospel,
your words breathed and your voice was gentle:

and pain floats lightly in my soul
dawn breaks in the heavens, the dream remains afloat

a flock of doves awakens and descends
their low, circling flight entangles me
the stars are a human touch on my breast.

adverse and confused lament of the world
but these are moments only, they disappear,
and the two-branched thought of my desire reigns alone.

when you came, strange and familiar, my beloved
to grant me, bending, the boundless deliverance

The broken sunset declined and was gone
and it seemed a delusion to ask for the gifts of the sky.

. . . In the mirror how our love diminishes
in sleep the dreams, school of oblivion
in the depths of time, how the heart contracts
and vanishes in the rocking of a foreign embrace. . .

Two serpents, beautiful, apart, tentacles of separation
crawl and search, in the night of the trees,
for a secret love in hidden bowers;
sleepless they search, they neither drink nor eat.

Circling, twisting, their insatiable intent
spins, multiplies, turns, spreads rings on the body
which the laws of the starry dome silently govern,
stirring its hot, irrepressible frenzy.

The forest stands as a shivering pillar for night
and the silence is a silver cup where moments fall
echoes distinct, whole, a careful chisel
sustained by carved lines. . .

The statue suddenly dawns. But the bodies have vanished
in the sea in the wind in the sun in the rain.
So the beauties nature grants us are born

The parted serpents must have circled in fantasy
(the forest shimmers with birds, shoots, blossoms)
their wavy searching still remains,
like the turnings of the cycle that bring sorrow.

Where is the double-edged day that had changed everything?
for the soul benumbed and nourished by the lotus?

On the stone of patience we wait for the miracle
that opens the heavens and makes all things possible
we wait for the angel as in the age-old drama
at the moment when the open roses of twilight

disappear. . . Red rose of the wind and of fate,
you remained in memory only, a heavy rhythm
rose of the night, you passed, undulating purple
undulation of the sea. . . The world is simple.

Dear Regret, my leaning this morning, my leather foot, want of stone, my age
Old, burnished and bruised, my hair lingering, my hand caked, spongy as
November my dear Relentless, my dear Aging, your voice tinny, dissonant 
Zeppelins over Piccadilly, bombing blindly in the fog. Dear Skin, dear Tobacco 
Mouth my refusal, my merely geographic, my fibrous strings for you: your 
Abundant wit, your lack of shadow and still joy nosing the air. Each moment 
Stretches toward you, your dry feet: I carried them, pumiced and peppery
Laid them where regret is a biscuit thing to lean upon and sweeten, 
My hour of you, my cursive thoughts, a pulpit beating under these ribs.

Dear Time, you swallowed us whole, swallowed us lovely, sharp as bones
Crimping sadly under foot my benign, my flotsam and crabs thin as leaves 
Your smoothing, your sinking in. Mornings or mooring, or wallowing 
Jericho: tapioca air indolent. I am still there, supple and driftwood, you lovely, 
You loved me, your memory dark and west, thoughts like tugboats stitching
The horizon, you pulling me, my pudding, my thin crustacean, sideways
In the late afternoon, your gaze, having so soon forgotten the sharpness 
Of mornings, the bite of your look serrating the hour: my treasures, all 
Of them, for the pleasure of that slice once more, of our dangling, 
You and me, the lot of us in some car, driving some hour, mapless. 

Under a spiderweb, a tire, slouched: flat, sad-lipped, I think of Newton 
Of the original apple, all of these clones since, all of these scentless 
Descents. I shake my glass, shake again, melted suffixes tinkling; observe 
All things natural: foliage unfurling like old bills, wryly betraying 
Your habits, like the dog who digs and rubs, the dog who whines, who
Paws and circles, you trace. Why is pain so much better than nothing? Or 
The mark of it more understandable? Why is saying nothing so much better? 
Your one-liner like blossoms, uplifting, your currents strap me to air, yes
Which if I recall, are sweet as kernels of corn, if I recall so long ago. 

To arrive is practice, conversation or conversion, a story over a field 
My Sweet, of concrete or whispering, furrows of a path no longer, not 
Sure, was there, and snow combed in curlicues and dog ears a zigzag 
Through January. Sure you are witty, but are you any less romantic? 
In my remembering, I have undone all my beliefs, it is a luxury to lay 
Unencumbered here, or there, the bones flexed with tendons, the 
Spine like a seahorse, the heart far from a cliche unless beating is
Innocent, though innocence is not as supple as you think, nor as flexible, 
Nor as perfumed, nor convenient, or even clean: between things regret 
Gathers force. I remember that day: it was cold and the coffee tepid.

The small red balloons like thumbprints, waves green as the brush of 
Cedar, the wind lapping your hoodie, blind strings tap the air, camera
The dogs of English Bay angling off-leash. I would follow backward, 
Lay old maps on your white sheets, so sincere, I am in earnest for you: 
Having the wind slip in under our belt loops, though I gently refuse 
Gor-Tex, and you bet I will not concede the game. Those small red 
Balloons like tulips in your eyes specs of amber, an amulet, an avatar, 
My thoughts of you fully indexed, ready to step into. 

Close to the gates of Paradise I flee; 
My God, my God, open the gates to me! 

My eyes are burning so I cannot see; 
My God, my God, open the gates to me! 

I ate the fruit of the forbidden tree, 
My God, my God, open the gates to me! 

Am I shut out for all eternity? 
My God, my God, open the gates to me! 

Let me come in where birds and flowers be; 
Lord God, Lord God, open the gates to me!

At the greyhound bus stations, at airports, at silent wharfs
the bodies exit the crafts. Women, men, children; cast out
from the new paradise.

They are not there in the homeland, in Argentina, not there
in Santiago, Chile; never there in Montevideo, Uruguay,
and they are not here

in America

They are in exile: a slow scream across a yellow bridge
the jaws stretched, widening, the eyes multiplied into blood
orbits, torn, whirling, spilling between two slopes; the sea, black,
swallowing all prayers, shadeless. Only tall faceless figures
of pain flutter across the bridge. They pace in charred suits,
the hands lift, point and ache and fly at sunset as cold dark
birds. They will hover over the dead ones: a family shattered
by military, buried by hunger, asleep now with the eyes burning

en exilio

From here we see them, we the ones from here, not there or across,
only here, without the bridge, without the arms as blue liquid
quenching the secret thirst of unmarked graves, without
our flesh journeying refuge or pilgrimage; not passengers
on imaginary ships sailing between reef and sky, we that die
here awake on Harrison Street, on Excelsior Avenue clutching
the tenderness of chrome radios, whispering to the saints
in supermarkets, motionless in the chasm of playgrounds,
searching at 9 a.m. from our third floor cells, bowing mute,
shoving the curtains with trembling speckled brown hands. Alone,
we look out to the wires, the summer, to the newspaper wound

in knots as matches for tenements. We that look out from
our miniature vestibules, peering out from our old clothes,
the father's well-sewn plaid shirt pocket, an old woman's
oversized wool sweater peering out from the makeshift kitchen.
We peer out to the streets, to the parades, we the ones from here
not there or across, from here, only here. Where is our exile?
Who has taken it?

It takes just two people to bring the world
to ruin. So goes the history of love.
At the end of the day we tally the casualties
of war, victory for the one who gets wounded
just the skin of some incandescent creature
whose grotesque beauty is what we adore,
whom some people call love, whom we
venerate because it consumes us, slim pickings
just around the bend. I say all we have
is unconditional surrender to the future.
So unreliable is the past that I feel compelled
to leave unmourned the blind, relentless loves
that may have scorched into our hearts
the way the saints accepted stigmata. My people say,
look back or lose your way. Or, walk backwards,
if you can. So I found myself on a bus to New York City
to lose myself completely. Past Hunters Point
from which a silk-like canopy of smoke rose to meet
as nebulous as Nebuchadnezzar, our live
not worth a footnote, our grandest schemes
no more than feeble whispers, all memory
shifting like the continental plates. In the future,
all science will finally come around; genetic
and we will be a super race in a world
infallibly perfected, where trains run on time,
love never dies, and hope can be purchased
of the cell lines. We will choose what will survive.
Our destiny made lucid, we will find the world
contemplating itself, like the young Narcissus,
one hand about to touch the pool, his body
lurched towards that marvelous reflection.
to desensitize our failures. My people say,
to go unnoticed, you play dead. I myself
may have chosen to forget a face, a name,
some cruel word uttered carelessly, but not,
after all the harm is done, intending any pain.
And many others may have chosen to forget me.
It works both ways. 

A doctor, of great skill and fame, 
Paulo Purganti was his name, 
Had a good, comely, virtuous wife; 
No woman led a better life: 
She to intrigue was ev'n hard hearted: 
She chuckled when a bawd was carted; 
And thought the nation ne'er would thrive, 
She thought no mercy should be had; 
They should be hanged, or starved, or flayed, 
Or served like Romish priests in Swede. 
In short, all lewdness she defied; 
And stiff was her parochial pride. 
Was a great lover of that same; 
And could from Scripture take her cue, 
That husbands should give wives their due. 
That, if in some regards, she chose
To curb poor Paulo in too close;
In others, she relaxed again,
And governed with a looser rein.
The doctor from excess of wine;
With oysters, eggs, and vermicelli,
She let him almost burst his belly:
Thus, drying coffee was denied;
But chocolate that want supplied;
(Blest resolution!) one might see
Eringo roots, and Bohea tea.
She often stroked the doctor's band,
And stroked his beard, and kissed his hand,
Kindly complained, that after noon
He went to pore on books too soon:
She held it wholesomer by much,
To rest a little on the couch;
About his waist in bed-a-nights
But had not always wherewithal.
Was lengthened by the Fox's tail;
And Art supplies, where Strength may fail.
The enemy he could not beat,
He strove to lengthen the campaign,
And save his forces by chicane.
Fabius, the Roman chief, who thus
By fair retreat grew Maximus,
Shows us, that all warrior can do,
With Love, and Joy, and Life, and Dear,
Our Don, who knew this tittle-tattle
Did, sure as trumpet, call to battle,
To ward against the coming blow:
To ward: But how? ay, there's the question:
Fierce the assault, unarmed the bastion.
He felt her pulse; he viewed her eyes;
That was too fast; these rolled too quick:
She was, he said, or would be sick:
He judged it absolutely good,
That she should purge, and cleanse her blood.
Spa-waters to that end were got:
If they passed easily or not,
What matters it? the lady's fever
Continued as violent as ever.
(Blackmore and Hans are of my mind)
If once it youthful blood infects,
Is scarce removed by pill or potion;
Whate'er may be our doctor's notion.
The doctor and the dame were laid,
Again this cruel fever came:
High pulse, short breath, and blood in flame.
What measures shall poor Paulo keep
She, like Macbeth, has murdered sleep,
Sad state of matters! when we dare
Nor ask for peace, nor offer war:
Nor Livy nor Comines have shown,
What in this juncture may be done.
Grotius might own, that Paulo's case is
Harder, than any which he places
He strove, alas, but strove in vain,
By dint of logic to maintain
Down to her Ladyship from Eve.
He ranged his tropes, and preached up patience;
Backed his opinion with quotations,
Divines and moralists; and run on
Quite through from Seneca to Bunyan.
As much in vain he bid her try
To fold her arms, to close her eye;
Telling her, rest would do her good,
If any thing in Nature could:
So held the Greeks quite down from Galen,
Masters and princes of the calling:
So all our modern friends maintain,
(Though no great Greeks) in Warwick-lane.
A tale should never be too long.
And sighed, and tossed, and groaned, and turned:
(And whispered something in his ear).
You wish! wish on, the doctor cries:
Lord! when will womankind be wise?
What! in your waters; are you mad?
Why, poison is not half so bad.
'Tis kind, my dear, what you advise,
The lady with a sign replies:
But life, you know, at best is pain:
And death is what we should disdain.
So do it therefore, and adieu:
Let wanton wives by death be scared:
But, to my comfort, I'm prepared.

This information may be not true.
The web cannot know intention.
It records and is open to influence.

People make money through advertisements,
if ads make money, that is more difficult

The web is full of special offers and 30-day

They are elevated to be made desirable.
Their desirability is physical because they are models.

At Samoa, hardly unpacked, I commenced planting,

Tomatoes and bush lima beans here and there
And yearn for a pet on a string. And I built the pig-house.

As fast as we eat them, we plant the tops.

October, 1890. I have been here nearly a month;
Put in corn, peas, onions, radishes, lettuce. Lima beans
Carruthers gave me mint root and grenadilla
Like a bouquet; he delivered a load of trees,
Then rounded off the afternoon sowing Indian corn.

My hurt healed by its cause, I go on planting.

No one else works much. The natives take it easy;
Mr. Carruthers and I picked a site for the kitchen garden.

I was planting a new lot of corn and pumpkin
I set them out as I talked to him on the way home.
I confided to Louis, a puff of the sweetest scent

I discovered the ylang-ylang tree: a base for perfume,
Though it suggested to me the odor of boots.
Another tree is scented like pepper and spice,
And one terrible tree, I am forced to say,
Smells like ordure ... It nearly made me ill.
Breadfruit is plentiful. I found a banana grove,
Began clearing it instantly, and worked till I was dizzy.

All fall I am cursed with asthma, rheumatics, a painful ear.
Louis describes it divinely to Henry James.
I set out one precious rhubarb plant, pause to gloat

I rise up from my furrow, knuckle smooth my brow
Louis insisted on going to Sydney, fell ill again.

Louis describes to me endless vivid deeps:

None perfect, a thousand tongues, all broken,
A thousand hands, all with scratching nails ...
High among joys, I place this delight of weeding,

They mimic his name till it seems, he says,
But the rain continues to fall on birds and weeds.
Mrs. S. gave me some nuts, and went back to Australia.

Avocados grow at a rate that is almost frightening.
Coconuts too. I read about Stanley and Livingstone.
Stanley the remedy. Instead, I made perfume.
The servants feared devils, so I planted the orange grove alone.

For two months I misplaced this diary ...
War is in the air, talk of killing all whites.
And a radish that turns into a turnip when it grows up.

The relatives had a terrible row. Mrs. S. refused
To pray with the servants. I threw up my hands!

My diary entries grow farther and farther apart.
In pain again, from an aneurysm inside my head ...
Three hundred seeds in baskets broke through the ground.

Four kinds of cabbage are doing very well.
Points out a weed which makes excellent eating
Cooked like asparagus. I shall try it very soon.
I refuse to see him. I am tired of the Claxtons.

The political situation grows grim. I rage at Louis
Throbbing, turns to my American son
To say he may drink to the President afterward
If he likes. I am writing this down
Hoping Louis will see it later, and be ashamed
Of his childishness and bad taste. (This will be erased.)

So now we are blazing with cacao fever,
The verandah tracked with mud, and the cacao litter.
Joe, my son-in-law, planted his thousandth tree today.

The jelly from berries out of the bush is delicious;
I plant cabbage by moonlight, set out more cacao.

I found a heap of old bones in a bush near the sty;
Louis gave the bones a funeral and a burial.

A series of hurricanes: Louis writes to The Times
Southern Cross cabbage, eggplant, sweet potato
David Balfour, is growing. I wrote nothing
The Samoan princes are getting nearer to war.

In a spectacular way. Belle is divorcing him.
Austin, my grandson, is in school in Monterey.
Belle and I go on sketching expeditions
To the hostile Samoan camps, stop in town for ginger beer.

Mr. Haggard begged us to stay in town
Because he bitterly wanted women to protect.
I suggested to him that I and my daughter

(The custom is to return them to the bereaved).
He washed it off and discovered it was his brother.

Kissing it, bathing it with his tears. A scandal arose
Because the heads of three girls have been taken as well
(Unheard of before in Samoa), returned wrapped in silk to their kin.
Between their teeth, cut in the semblance of heads.

I stopped writing this. Too hysterical with migraine.
Louis works on his masterpiece, The Weir of Hermiston.
So they might enjoy his glorious talk in London,

Later: At six, Louis helped with the mayonnaise,
To the top of the mountain. They will dig his grave.

I will have pretty gardens wherever I am,
Never again succumb to the fever of planting.

Before the days of self service,
when you never had to pump your own gas,
I was the one who did it for you, the girl
who stepped out at the sound of a bell
with a blue rag in my hand, my hair pulled back
in a straight, unlovely ponytail.
This was before automatic shut-offs
and vapor seals, and once, while filling a tank,
I hit a bubble of trapped air and the gas
backed up, came arcing out of the hole
belly and legs. And I had to hurry
back to the booth, the small employee bathroom
with the broken lock, to change my uniform,
peel the gas-soaked cloth from my skin
and wash myself in the sink.
Light-headed, scrubbed raw, I felt
glazed my flesh, the searing,
subterranean pain of it, how my skin
shimmered and ached, glowed
like rainbowed oil on the pavement.
I was twenty. In a few weeks I would fall,
for the first time, in love, that man waiting
patiently in my future like a red leaf
on the sidewalk, the kind of beauty
that asks to be noticed. How was I to know
it would begin this way: every cell of my body
burning with a dangerous beauty, the air around me
a nimbus of light that would carry me
through the days, how when he found me,
weeks later, he would find me like that,
an ordinary woman who could rise
in flame, all he would have to do
is come close and touch me.

Father: 

Son: 
But sure. I can already tell
From no felt, had, and wholly known things.

Father: 
You must let me tell you what you fear
You are afraid of time and its slow drip,
Like melting ice, like smoke upon the air
Because its name is death. But you can stop
Time as it dribbles from you, drop by drop.

Son: 

Father: 
That is the first of all its menaces,
All of us always are turning away
To one indeterminate nothing.

Son:
I question the sentiment you give to me,
I would be sudden now and rash in joy,
As if I lived forever, the future my toy.
Time is a dancing fire at twenty-one,
Powerful at the wheel of a motor-car,
Not thinking of death which is foreign and far.

Father: 
See the evasions which so many don,
The one anonymous in the audience,
The one expressionless in the subway,
Separate from actor and act, a member
Of public opinion, never involved.
At the band concert, Hawaii
Because one is afraid to be alone,
But there is a stay. You can stop
Time as it dribbles from you, drop by drop.

Son: 
Now I am afraid. What is there to be known?

Father: 
Guilt, guilt of time, nameless guilt.
Your actual will. Stand in mastery,
Keeping time in you, its terrifying mystery.
Face yourself, constantly go back
To what you were, your own history.
You are always in debt. Do not forget
Pleasure immediate as drink, but takes
The travail of building, patience with means.
The ideal which is with us like the sky ...

Son: 
Because of that, some laugh, and others cry.

Father: 
Returns with its memories, always, always,
The phoenix with eight hundred thousand memories!

Son: 
What must I do that is most difficult?

Father: 
You must, like one in an old play,
Hanging from the fiftieth-story ledge,
When the news is certain, surpassing fear,
The irreducible wish, world without end.

Son: 
I cannot partake of your difficult vision.

Father: 
Hamlet is the example; only dying
Done with revery.
Your own self acts then, then you know.

Son: 
My father has taught me to be serious.

Father: 
Be guilty of yourself in the full looking-glass.
I lift your body to the boat  
before you drown or choke or slip too far  

what I did like the physics  

year-old arms, between your life  

jacket and your bobbing frame, pushing you,  
like a fountain cherub, up and out.  

the gash on my thigh, sliced wide and clean  

by an errant screw on the stern.  

My arms strain  
against our deaths to hold you up  

as I lift you, crying, reaching, to the boat.

Out of a high meadow where flowers
bloom above cloud, come down;
pursue me with reasons for smiling without malice.

Bring mimic pride like that of the seedling fir,
surprise in the perfect leg-stems
and queries unstirred by recognition or fear
pooled in the deep eyes.

Come down by regions where rocks
lift through the hot haze of pain;
down landscapes darkened, crossed
by the rift of death-shock; place print
of a neat hoof on trampled ground
where not one leaf or root
remains unbitten; but come down
always, accompany me to the morass
of the decaying mind. There

I need more time, a simple day in Paris hotels and window shopping.
The croissants will not bake themselves and the Tower of London would
Like to spend a night in the tropics with gray sassy paint. It has many
Wounds and historic serial dreams under contract to Hollywood.
Who will play the head of Mary, Queen of Scots, and who will braid her

Hair? Was it she who left her lips on the block for the executioner,
Whose hands would never find ablution, who would never touch a woman
Again or eat the flesh of a red animal? Blood pudding would repulse him
Until joining Anne. That is the way of history written for Marlow and
Shakespear. They are with us now that we are sober and wiser,

Not taking the horrors of poetry too seriously. Why am I telling you this
Nonsense, when I have never seen you sip your coffee or tea,
In the morning? Not to mention,
Never heard you sing, although some claim it is quite grand.
Will you teach me to sing like Chaliapin? Will I impress you with my

Cartoon Russian accent? I like sour cream and borsht;
We went to school together. My minor was caviar and blinis.
This is what it means to listen to Boris Godunov late at night.
But why should we speak in a foreign language to each other,

We are not birds. I have other stories too strange and beautiful to be
Told. They have no sound or memory. They will rest on your lips when
You bring your hands to your mouth to stop their gush of air against your
Face. We should go back and meet again at the street fair of cufflinks.
Our hearts teach us how to fly with wings of pain.

That is the price of the disarticulated lessons we should not abstain from
Playing. The accumulated misdemeanors add up to the most egregious
Felony: ignoring the demands of the heart. We remain in abeyance to
The muses who are only interested in their outcomes,
We are just the worms on their hooks of selfishness.

What do they care, we are not Greek. We are just a dream of pleasant
Comic arias that suffice as whims in the morning.
We are small enemies to them with strange large hearts that control the
Weather in the heavens. They cannot change or unteach us not to
Trespass their quarters of endowment. Perhaps, after all, you are an

Affable spirit bubbling over with your own deductions to minimize the
Pointed dots in your beautiful endeavors.
Although I feel like a bird with a broken wing,
Each day I think of you I fumble an attempt to fly to impress you with
The color of my paper wings.

When we go out into the fields of learning
We go by a rough route
Marked by colossal statues, Frankenstein's
Monsters, AMPAC and the 704,
AARDVARK, and deoxyribonucleic acid.
They guard the way.
Headless they nod, wink eyeless,
Thoughtless compute, not heartless,
For they figure us, they figure
Our next turning.
They are reading the book to be written.
As we start out
At first daylight into the fields, they are saying,
Starting out.

In every sage leaf is contained a toad
Infinitely small.

Carbonized grains of wheat unearthed
From the seventh millennium B.C. town of Jarmo
In the Tigris-Euphrates basin
Match the grains of three kinds of wheat still extant,
Two wild, one found only in cultivation.
The separate grains
Were parched and eaten,
Or soaked into gruel, yeasted, fermented.
Took to the idea of bread,
Ceres, while you were gone.
Wind whistles in the smokey thatch,
Oven browns its lifted loaf,
And in the spring the nourished seeds,
Hybrid with wild grass,
Easily open in a hundred days,
And seeded fruits, compact and dry,
Store well together.
They make the straw for beds,
They ask the caring hand to sow, the resting foot
To stay, to court the seasons.

Basil: hatred: king over pain.

What did you do on the last day of day camp?
First we did games, running around and playing.
Then we did crafts, making things.
Then we did nature, what goes on and on.
Eventually a number
Of boys have got big enough
Through all the hazards of drag-racing, theft, and probation,
To start for junior college, two transfers away,
Mysterious as Loch Ness.
While of grandmothers a number
Have stooping arrived to seventy or eighty
And wave the boys on, shaking
With more absentminded merriment than they have mustered
In half a century.

King Henry the Eighth consumed many daisies
In an attempt to rid himself of ulcers.

Algebra written across a blackboard hurts
As a tight shoe hurts; it can't be walked in.
Music, a song score, hurts,
How far lies one note from another?
Graft hurts, its systems of exploitation
In cold continuance.
Argosies of design, fashions to which the keys
Rest restlessly in an Egyptian tomb.

In every sage leaf is contained a toad
Infinitely small.

He was too excited to fall asleep.
He took out his gun.
He took out his handkerchief.
He took out his notebook.
He drank his coffee and left a dime.
He walked into the room.
He took her in his arms.
She let him in and walked out of the room.
He ran down the escalator.

He left the motor running.
He waited in the rain.
He needed something to tell the police.
He went down unconscious.
The blood drained from his face.
His eyes melted into a smile.
He dialed and waited, looking around.
He took off his hat in the elevator.
He rang the doorbell and waited.
He poured the cereal and added milk.

He opened the refrigerator and looked in.
He turned the page and continued reading.
He shut the door and switched the light on.
He looked up at a plane in the sky.
He put three pennies one on top of another.
He squeezed onto the elevator.
He took out his key.
He helped her into her coat.
He crossed the room and picked up the phone.
He drove on through the heavy rain.

He whistled for a cab.
He turned the corner and bumped into her.
She gradually surrendered to his kiss.
He drove past the wrought-iron gates.
He lit a cigarette and waited.
He lied to the police.
He threw the dice and won.
He folded the newspaper and crossed his legs.
He sat down in the lobby.
He tied his shoes and stood up.

He thought about her until he fell asleep.
He threw the dice and lost.
He dialed and waited for her to answer.
He left some money for her.
He looked for her door number.
The police arrived late.
He walked into her building.
He let her do the explaining.

He gave up hope and begged.
He locked his car and walked.
She gave him that look of hers.
He put a finger to his lips.
He wiped his mouth and left.
He slapped her across the face hard.
He lit a cigarette in the dark.
Her little dog slept.
Her voice had an edge to it.

Her hands were wonderful when she touched him.
His mind might be playing tricks on him.
The low hills reminded him of her.
There was no way to cut his losses.
He needed a shave and a haircut.
The coffee did nothing for him.
She was somewhere else when he called.
Pain stabbed him as he reached toward the glove compartment.
He needed a little time in the desert.
He decided to head for the beach and then thought better.

He needed about $5,000.
He ran out of Luckies and crumpled the pack.
He left his hat on in the car.
Maybe he was ready to die.
He checked his wallet pocket.
All of his friends had disappeared.
He remembered her naked body.
He had almost no savings.
He was at least ten pounds overweight.
He realized he was in love with her.

One of the spectators is disappointed
the beaching, the scientists busy
cutting into ninety-four pilot whales
stranded on the salt grass.
No one knows why and, try as the rescue team
might, not one whale will go back to water.
lined up like lumber and sawed into,
except when the black skin splits
what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly
finished their love of motion. Why should
anything have to leave this world
when water can cycle from atmosphere
down to land, the ocean and back
to forgiving sky.

the danger of him slipping
into a haze so cold, some nights,
his plate to his mouth.
slowing me down. The same water
fattened into snow in the woods
of my childhood, the whiteness
unbroken except where my father
cut trails and taught me to ski,
laying down the herringbone behind him
as he broke up hills that left me
with legs made of slush. He wanted me strong,
no patience for pain. No choice
but to find the muscle to follow. Even now
when he boasts how I zigzagged
the breakneck hills in an icestorm,
slats skittering out of control,
each run a victory of luck more than will,
each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.
I wonder how it is for him now
beached, spectators came like pilgrims,
each new arrival scanning the faces
of those heading back to their cars
to see how it changed them
to survey so much death. Nothing showed.
Their eyes followed the asphalt,
heads bent in private devotion.
where others have died, my father
keeps a record of each test and drug.
He watches medicine drip into his arm
and circle in the dark of his blood.
I believe it will heal him, as I believe
in the strength of my blood
to protect me from failures of will. Once
when my grandmother at ninety-six
lay delirious with pneumonia,
pitching on her high horsehair bed,
she saw three crows perched on the dresser.
Please, open the window. Let them out.
It was my father who did what she asked.
And the crows flew out, carrying her fever
over the treeline, dissolving into sky,
and she lived. Whatever she saw,
by love, luck or dumb Yankee will,

The women bow and flutter in the field. 
Summer is dark, as in the ancient time. 

Has darkened now, as in the ancient time, 
And clouds are still at dawn on the soft mountains. 

The stir of boughs has warned us, 
Fruit in the grass reminds us . . . 

But thirst. When we entered the towns 
We stayed to hear their dangerous low voices. 

By night the leaves are years 
And distant each one in that silvered dark. 
Or mothers risen infamous from the grave. 

In the void ether, visions 
Famished through interminable dark, 
Trembling in single wonder of themselves. 

We knew we were alone upon that water; 
Or on long fields in a leaf-blowing autumn, 
Lonely under the high kick, toward the tackle 
Bitter turf our vision, so alone there 
Waiting for pain in the numb fracture, listened. 

Always to question a still room ourselves: 
When winter lifted her cool beams 
Till waking tendons netted us alive. 

Head reared into the morning. 

And in cold mirrors our deep eyes, 
Familiars of starlight, curious 
Interpreters of the sun, the fire and clear 
Waterlights of noon upon our walls: 
Webs for the spring of shadow. 
So hurt, so sorry, so angry, so ashamed . . . 

Avid, delicate harlots: those pale ones 
Impaled on phalloi in a pantomime 
Wriggled a squealing answer to our love. 

We sat on our two bones and we were blind. 
Glowed in the time-drift 
Small as a minuet-whisper and as dear. 
Mowers on many lawns, leveling summer, 
Measured the slow festival of the air; 

Or in bright gusts of winter by the door, 
Our mothers in their ceremonial furs, 
This image or another bound in thought 
With scent of old spoons, handkerchiefs and roses. 

Removed us from their rooms. 

Plains were a long gaze and a sigh from hills. 

We moved there always in the northern weather, 
Briefly together or alone, 
Under us, the fiery power sound 
Swelling the road backward. Against glass 
And starlings rising in stillness on meadowlands. 

Or walked upon an aerodrome in our dream 
Their wings sighing home. 

Riding with dark engines depth of wind, 
Sea lay, quicksilver, eastward, and a sail 
Perched like the white pinch of a butterfly . . . 

Over the dials our enormous hands . . . 

Under their curtains icy air. We swam 
Against the snowfields like a scarecrow. 
Cars were steaming in that gash of light, 
Memoried evening and the cypress shades: 

In their streets wandered, listening to the flutist who loved 
His single note, sweet in the russet shuffle 
Or slowly in the evening dust and gold 
Such courtesy, not gross enough for time . . . 

heard sea-music and the slap of seas; 
Odysseus, our father, wanderer; 
Unkindly glory from the islands, 
When in her temple the wind lifted 
Above the shy sandals, shadowed dance . . . 

Organs raging, Holy, Holy, Holy, 
Far off on a low violet imagined land. 

Legends of their lord Christ: they were strange men. 

The child caught in the glass: unhistoried years 

Where no leaf burned but sundown in his hall, 

Of evil rising in the shade of war, 
Dissolving shining things . . . dissolving 
The young men on their benches into death. 

Slowly pacing the gutters 

I like to touch your tattoos in complete
where they are, know by heart the neat
lines of lightning pulsing just above
your nipple, can find, as if by instinct, the blue
swirls of water on your shoulder where a serpent
twists, facing a dragon. When I pull you

and quiet on the sheets, I love to kiss
or turns to pain between us, they will still
be there. Such permanence is terrifying.
So I touch them in the dark; but touch them, trying.

The question is: how does one hold an apple
Who likes apples

And how does one handle
Filth? The question is

How does one hold something
In the mind which he intends

To grasp and how does the salesman
Hold a bauble he intends

To sell? The question is
When will there not be a hundred

Poets who mistake that gesture
For a style.

The little hole in the eye
Williams called it, the little hole

Has exposed us naked
To the world

And will not close.

Blankly the world
Looks in

And we compose
Colors

And the sense

Of home
And there are those

In it so violent
And so alone

They cannot rest.

Sing like a bird at the open
Sky, but no bird

Like the grip
Of the Roman hand
On his shoulder, the certainties

Of place
And of time

Held him, I think
With the pain and the casual horror
Of the iron and may have left
No hope of doubt

Whereas we have won doubt
From the iron itself

And hope in death. So that
If a man lived forever he would outlive
Hope. I imagine open sky

Over Gethsemane,
Surely it was this sky.

Impossible to doubt the world: it can be seen
And because it is irrevocable

It cannot be understood, and I believe that fact is lethal

And man may find his catastrophe,
His Millennium of obsession.

a stone on a stone,
something balanced momentarily, in time might the lion

Lie down in the forest, less fierce
And solitary

Than the world, the walls
Of whose future may stand forever.

I, says the buzzard,

Mind

Has evolved
Too long

Also is not good

For us
Unless like the fool

Persisting
In his folly

It may rescue us
As only the true

Might rescue us, gathered
In the smallest corners

O small boy,
To be born;

On whom his parents have not smiled

No god thinks worthy of his table,

Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet;
Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.
There, wrapp'd in cloud of sorrow, pity move,
And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love:
But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,
Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return again.

  All that I sung still to her praise did tend,
Still she was first; still she my songs did end;
Yet she my love and music both doth fly,
The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy.
Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight:
It shall suffice that they were breath'd and died for her delight.

Thank Heaven! the crisis,
    The danger, is past,
And the lingering illness
And the fever called "Living"
    Is conquered at last.

Sadly, I know
    I am shorn of my strength,
And no muscle I move
    I am better at length.

And I rest so composedly,
    Now, in my bed,
That any beholder
Might start at beholding me,
    Thinking me dead.

The moaning and groaning,
    The sighing and sobbing,
Are quieted now,
    With that horrible throbbing
    Horrible throbbing!

Have ceased, with the fever
With the fever called "Living"
    That burned in my brain.

And oh! of all tortures
That torture the worst
    Torture of thirst
For the naphthaline river
I have drank of a water

Of a water that flows,
    With a lullaby sound,
From a spring but a very few
From a cavern not very far
    Down under ground.

And ah! let it never
    Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
    And narrow my bed;
For man never slept
And, to sleep, you must slumber
    In just such a bed.

My tantalized spirit
    Here blandly reposes,
Forgetting, or never
Its old agitations
    Of myrtles and roses:

For now, while so quietly
    Lying, it fancies
A holier odor
A rosemary odor,
With rue and the beautiful
    Puritan pansies.

And so it lies happily,
    Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
Drowned in a bath
    Of the tresses of Annie.

She tenderly kissed me,
    She fondly caressed,
And then I fell gently
Deeply to sleep
    From the heaven of her breast.

When the light was extinguished,
    She covered me warm,
And she prayed to the angels
To the queen of the angels
    To shield me from harm.

And I lie so composedly,
    Now, in my bed,
(Knowing her love)
And I rest so contentedly,
    Now in my bed
(With her love at my breast).
That you shudder to look at me,

But my heart it is brighter
    Than all of the many
Stars in the sky,
It glows with the light
With the thought of the light
    Of the eyes of my Annie.

I love her fierceness when she fights me, 
shouting "Not fair!" Her eyes slitting 
like shutters in cities by the sea. 
fires that burn through the turning years 
bringing her to life again, and again, in a miracle of smoke. 
she kisses my back, capriciously, when I scold her. 
Maybe she recalls the scalpel by which she was born. 
Easy, the mark of its slash in my skin. 
She rose from my belly as I slept. We're bound together 
by peace, no shrieks of pain, and my modesty. 
We're a canvas by Giovanni Bellini: a virgin and a sweet rabbit.

How were we to know, leaving your two kids 
behind in New Hampshire for our honeymoon 
at twenty-one, that it was a trick of cheap 
hotels in New York City to draw customers 
like us inside by displaying a fancy lobby? 
Arriving in our fourth-floor room, we found 
a bed, a scarred bureau, and a bathroom door 
with a cut on one side the exact shape 
of the toilet bowl that was in its way 
when I closed it. I opened and shut the door, 
admiring the fit and despairing of it. You 
discovered the initials of lovers carved 
How wrong the place was to us then, 
unable to see the portents of our future 
disdain for those with little money, 
the carving of pain and love. Yet in that room 
we pulled the covers over ourselves and lay 
our love down, and in this way began our unwise 
and persistent and lucky life together. 

Did your father come home after fighting
through the week at work? Did the sweat change
to salt in his ears? Was that bitter white
you were quiet when other poets sang
you choked on the tonsil of Negro Duty?
Were there as many offices for pain
as love? Should a black man never be shy?
Was your father a mountain twenty
leaving a lone column of smoke? Was he
a black magnolia singing at your feet?
Was he a blackjack smashed against your throat?

a seven-letter skidmark that scars up  
across your chest, a flare of indelible script.  
Between Death or Glory, and Mama, she rages,  
scales the trellis of your rib cage;  
her red hair swings down to bracket your ankles, whip  
you sleepless with her afterimage,  

and each pinned and martyred limb aches for more.  
Her memory wraps you like a vise.  
How simple the pain that trails and graces  
bruises into wisdom you have no name for.
